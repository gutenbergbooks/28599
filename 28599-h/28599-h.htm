 /></span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Any</span> survey of the work done by Australian
authors suggests a question as to what length
of time ought to be allowed for the development
of distinctive national characteristics in
the literature of a young country self-governing
to the extent of being a republic in all
but name, isolated in position, highly civilised,
enjoying all the modern luxuries available to
the English-speaking race in older lands, and
with a population fully two-thirds native.
The common saying that a country cannot
be expected to produce literature during the
earlier state of its growth is too vague a
generalisation. There are circumstances by
which its application may be modified. It
certainly does not apply with equal force to
<a name="png.006" id="png.006"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">2</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>a country whose early difficulties included
race conflicts, war with an external power
and political labours of great magnitude, and
to another whose commercial and social development,
carried on under more modern
conditions by a people almost entirely homogeneous,
has been facile, unbroken and extraordinarily
rapid.</p>

<p>Nor can paucity of literary product, where
it exists, be satisfactorily explained by the
unrest that continues in a new land long
after it has attained material prosperity and
the higher refinements of life. The Americans
are a type of an extremely restless people.
They have been so throughout the greater
part of their history, and the characteristic is
now more marked than ever. It is a fixed
condition of their national being, an expression
of the cumulative ambition that is the
source of their varied progress. Yet from
time to time men have arisen among them
who not only have given intimate views of a
new civilisation, but have added something
to the permanent stock of what Matthew
Arnold used to call &lsquo;the best that is known
<a name="png.007" id="png.007"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">3</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>and thought in the world.&rsquo; Even when the
independent nationhood of the United States
was still but an aspiration, Benjamin Franklin
had familiarised Europe with much that has
since been recognised as inherent in the
modes of thought and manners of the Western
race.</p>

<p>The bulk of the literature of America is, of
course, still small in proportion to the culture
and intellectual energy of the country; but
it has been and is sufficient to interpret in a
more or less distinctive way all the leading
phases in the evolution of the national
thought and sentiment. The subtle influence
of the deeply-grounded religious feeling
which, implanted by the Puritan pioneers,
has survived generations of intense absorption
in material progress and the distractions
that modern life offers to the possessors of
newly-acquired wealth; the pride of the
people in their independence, and their
natural tendency to overrate it in comparison;
with the conditions of other countries; the
contrasts furnished by a society fond of reproducing
European habits, yet retaining a
<a name="png.008" id="png.008"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">4</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>simplicity and freshness of its own: these
and other features in the progress of the
United States for over a century may be
found expressed in its literature from the
native standpoint, and not merely from that
of the intelligent outside observer.</p>

<p>An American writer in discussing, a few
years ago, the quality of the literature produced
before the War of Secession, when
wealth and leisure were abundant among the
planters and in the principal New England
towns, observed that &lsquo;there would seem to
be something in the relation of a colony to
the mother-country which dooms the thought
and art of the former to a hopeless provincialism.&rsquo;
If a comment so largely fanciful
could be made respecting Australasia and
Canada, it would practically mean&mdash;at all
events from the American point of view&mdash;that
as long as they remain dependencies of
Great Britain, and therefore lack the stimulus
of an active patriotism, so long will much of
whatever is individual in their social development
and national aspirations be without
expression.  In the case of the Australasian
<a name="png.009" id="png.009"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">5</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>colonies it would further mean (apart from
any consideration of their future independence)
that a people far removed from other
communities of the same race and already
giving promise of being the greatest power
south of the equator, must continue for an
indefinite period to be wholly sustained and
swayed in matters of thought and art by a
country over twelve thousand miles distant
that happens for the present to offer the
most convenient markets in which to buy
and sell. The point need hardly be discussed,
but it suggests some facts in the
intellectual life of Australia that it will be of
interest to name. These may not be found
to explain why there is yet no sign of the
coming of an Antipodean Franklin or Irving,
or Hawthorne or Emerson; but they will
help to show why the literature of the country
grows so unevenly, why it is chiefly of the
objective order and leaves large tracts of the
life of the people untouched.</p>

<p>Perhaps the paradox that a people may
read a great deal and yet not be interested
in literature could hardly be applied to the
<a name="png.010" id="png.010"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">6</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Australians, but it is a fact that they make
no special effort to encourage the growth of
a literature of their own. By no means unconscious
of their achievements in other
directions&mdash;in political innovations, in sport
and athletics&mdash;they appear not to take any
pride in or see the advantage of promoting
creative intellectual work. Will this be considered
natural and reasonable, as already
they are supplied with books and plays and
pictures from England and Europe, or as a
proof of thoughtlessness and neglect? &lsquo;Why,&rsquo;
asked a critic in the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite> in
1819, &lsquo;should the Americans write books
when a six weeks&#8217; passage brings them, in
their own tongue, our sense, science, and
genius in bales and hogsheads?&rsquo; Are the
Australians of these days asking themselves
a similar question? It would seem so. In
1894 they imported books, magazines and
newspapers from the United Kingdom to
the value of £363,741: this, too, at a time
when most of the colonies were understood
to be rigidly economising in consequence of
a financial crisis.  A decade before the
<a name="png.011" id="png.011"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">7</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>amount was not far short of a hundred
thousand pounds higher.</p>

<p>Foremost in his list of the salient intellectual
tendencies of the native population of
the United States Mr. Bryce places &lsquo;a desire
to be abreast of the best thought and work
of the world everywhere, and to have every
form of literature and art adequately represented
and excellent of its kind, so that
America shall be felt to hold her own among
the nations.&rsquo; And he further attributes to
them &lsquo;an admiration for literary or scientific
eminence, an enthusiasm for anything that
can be called genius, with an over-readiness
to discover it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Artistic talent in America has from an
early period in the history of the country
enjoyed the stimulus of local respect and
attention. Mr. Henry James has testified to
the &lsquo;extreme honour&rsquo; in which writers and
artists have always been held there. Literature
is now a subject of special systematic
study in all the important schools; literary
organisations are numerous, including no
fewer than five thousand circles for the study
<a name="png.012" id="png.012"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">8</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>of Shakespeare; authorship has become something
like a craze in fashionable society; the
intelligence of the criticism in the weekly
press is on the whole equal to that in English
journals; and several of the magazines are
largely devoted to the more artistic kinds of
writing. If the results of these incentives to
production seem comparatively small, as they
undoubtedly do, it must not be forgotten that
the profession of letters in America long
suffered, and is still suffering, from the absence
of international copyright law. Before
the year 1891 the markets were filled with
cheap reprints of British and European works
(often of an inferior class), and even now
authors have to encounter competition with
a vast quantity of foreign matter of which
copyright, owing to the peculiar conditions
of the law and of the publishing trade, is
often obtained at prices much below its real
value.</p>

<p>It is not, however, the native literary product
of America that is noteworthy so much
as the widespread and conscious taste for
literature among the people, and the means
<a name="png.013" id="png.013"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">9</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>which they adopt to promote it. The best
friend of Australia could not credit it at present
with any markedly active desire &lsquo;to have
every form of literature and art adequately
represented and excellent of its kind.&rsquo; In
this respect the results of the high standard
of education attained in the Government
schools and the subsidised Universities are
disappointing. The Universities of Sydney
and Melbourne will soon be fifty years old,
but neither is yet represented with distinction
in the higher forms of literature and art.
The Governments, at least, do their duty.
Having liberally provided for school education,
they spend annually large sums in
making additions to picture-galleries, in
maintaining libraries (of which there are over
eleven hundred), technological schools and
museums, and in other ways adding to the
comfort and enlightenment of the people.
But large private contributions are rare, and
the founding or endowment of public institutions
still rarer.</p>

<p>Of societies or clubs devoted specially
to the interests of literature there are very
<a name="png.014" id="png.014"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">10</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>few&mdash;probably not half a dozen. Here and
there among the upper classes there are little
coteries whose members read the English and
French reviews, and are well posted in all
movements of interest in the world of letters,
but there is no actual organisation among
them, and they do not seek to extend their
influence. Their ambition is confined to providing
for their personal improvement and
pleasure. The reading of the people, though
extensive, is not serious nor in any way
specialised, unless a recent notably high
average of borrowing in the historical departments
of a few of the free libraries be
taken into account. The leading book exporters
in London say that throughout the
Antipodes the public demand is confined, as
in England, mainly to the &lsquo;general&rsquo; literature
of the hour. &lsquo;Whatever has succeeded in
London will usually succeed in Australia&rsquo; is
the invariable remark of the exporter and
the first principle that guides his tentative
selection in the case of all newly-published
works. The circulation of the best British
weekly and monthly reviews by some of the
<a name="png.015" id="png.015"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">11</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>principal subscription libraries helps the
reader to choose for himself, but if he should
wish to buy a new book, however valuable,
that has not become popular in the business
sense, he will probably have to send to
London for it.</p>

<p>The wealthy people seem to select their
reading-matter chiefly with a view to entertainment.
Not long ago the manager of one
of the most fashionable of the Melbourne
circulating libraries said that about ninety
per cent. of the female and seventy-five per
cent. of the male frequenters of such libraries
in Australia read only novels. But this
average is perhaps rather over-stated, being
given at a time when there was an exceptional
demand for certain novels that had
obtained notoriety by an audacious treatment
of sex questions and English society.</p>

<p>A glance at the fare which fourteen of the
London publishers provide in their colonial
editions is of interest. Excellent value, of
its kind, is usually offered in these issues, but
here again we find proclaimed an excessive
preference for light prose literature. Of 264
<a name="png.016" id="png.016"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">12</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>volumes in one &lsquo;colonial library,&rsquo; 238 are of
fiction. Sketches, memoirs, reminiscences
and a few essays make up most of the
balance. The taste of the working classes,
so far as it can be ascertained from the
records of the principal free libraries, is,
curious as it may seem, decidedly sounder
than that attributed to the customers of the
subscription libraries. It must be remembered,
however, that the former are seldom
tempted with new fiction, and never with
fiction of the spicy or questionable kind.
Some of the larger institutions are rigidly exclusive
in regard to the light kinds of literature.</p>

<p>Authorship in Australia loses an important
incentive in the absence of local magazines.
All of the better kind have lacked sufficient
public support. Several of them, including
the <cite>Colonial Monthly</cite> (established by Marcus
Clarke), the <cite>Melbourne Review</cite>, the <cite>Centennial
Magazine</cite>, and the <cite>Australasian Critic</cite>
(the latter conducted by the professors of the
Melbourne University) promised so well that
their want of support is not easily explainable.
It has been attributed to an unreasoning
<a name="png.017" id="png.017"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">13</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>prejudice, an assumption that being locally
produced they must necessarily be inferior;
but this probably does the reading public less
than justice. Apparently from their contents,
most of the magazines failed because
they were made too Australian in character,
too unlike the English periodicals to which
readers had been so long accustomed. There
are many fine magazines in the United
States, but their conductors do not make
the mistake of trying to do without British
and European contributions. They know
the value of names as well as of matter.
Foreign writers supply about one-third of
the contents of the monthlies. When great
interest suddenly attaches to some national
question, their enterprise, like that of the
newspapers of the country, sometimes takes
the special form of securing cabled summaries
of the opinions of influential politicians
in Great Britain and elsewhere for immediate
publication.</p>

<p>A contributory cause of the failure of Australian
magazines is the fact that the cost of
their mechanical production has always been
<a name="png.018" id="png.018"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">14</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>higher than that of any of their imported
competitors. This promises to be a difficulty
for some years to come. Book-publishing, as
a separate business, is also practically impossible,
for like reasons. The Australian reader
attaches no special value to the possibilities
of the local magazine, partly because its
place as a literary and art record is considered
to be fairly supplied by the weekly
newspapers. Moreover, it is said he demands
cheapness as well as high quality in
his periodicals, and knows that both can be
got in several English, American and European
magazines. If this be so, the same
predilection will no doubt account for the
spectacle of leading London firms sending
to the colonies tons of their popular modern
books in paper covers, and offering them at
about half the price charged in the United
Kingdom, where they are obtainable only in
cloth-bound editions.</p>

<p>That no one has yet lived by the production
of literature in Australia is not a
matter for surprise. No one, indeed, would
seriously think of attempting to do so.

Service; Mr. B.&nbsp;L. Farjeon&#8217;s colonial work
was mainly done in connection with the New
Zealand press; Messrs. Marriott, Watson,
E. W. Hornung, J.&nbsp;F. Hogan, Haddon
Chambers and Guy Boothby, among younger
writers, have taken their talents to London;
and none of the half-dozen female novelists
have been dependent upon literature for a
livelihood.</p>

<p>What, it may be asked, becomes of the
best talent developed by the Australian
schools and Universities? It is employed, or
tries to find employment, in the practice of
<a name="png.020" id="png.020"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">16</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>law, medicine, journalism and teaching. From
law to politics is but a step in the colonies,
and the chances of attaining Cabinet rank,
rendered frequent by the prevailing aggressive
form of party government, are often
attractive to men of ability and ambition.
The journalists are more or less drenched
with politics all the year round, and they,
too, occasionally find it an easy matter to
vary their occupation by assisting in the
active business of law-making.  The tension
of their daily lives, severer than that of the
majority of press writers in Great Britain,
leaves them little or no leisure for literary
work of the higher kind, and generally the
prospect of being compelled to send whatever
they might write to the other end of the
world for the chance of publication discourages
effort. It may safely be said that there are
young men on the editorial and reporting
staffs of a dozen of the principal journals who
possess ability that would secure them distinction
in the wider fields of England or
America. To their skill and spirited rivalry
is due the universally high quality of the
<a name="png.021" id="png.021"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">17</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Antipodean press. Mr. David Christie
Murray, writing after considerable experience
of the colonies, and as one who had
been an English journalist, said that on the
whole he was &lsquo;compelled to think it by far
and away the best in the world.&rsquo; The remark
is without exaggeration so far as it
applies to the large weekly journals.</p>

<p>The extent of the favour shown by Australian
readers to the works of their own
novelists is, as a rule, exactly proportioned
to that which their merits have previously
won in England. Booksellers and their
London agents, who of course treat all literature
from a purely commercial standpoint,
are at all events unanimous in discrediting
the existence in recent years of any prejudice
against colonial fiction of the better class. It
is now very seldom sent out in two or three
volume form, they say, but neither are the
most popular English novels, except occasionally
to subscription libraries. For representative
Australian work, then, there is a
fair field but no favour. It is as though the
function and existence of the authors apart
<a name="png.022" id="png.022"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">18</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>from the rank and file of English letters
were not recognised. There is an exception
to this rule in the poet Gordon, as a portion
of his writings, the Bush <cite>Ballads and Galloping
Rhymes</cite>, irresistibly commemorate the
national love of horseflesh and outdoor life.
Every Australian now knows that <cite>For the
Term of his Natural Life</cite> is a great novel of
its class; but as a leading Victorian journalist
(Mr. James Smith) once pointed out in an
article in the <cite>Melbourne Review</cite>, Clarke&#8217;s
real merit was for years undervalued, because
he was known to be &lsquo;only a colonial writer.&rsquo;
Thousands of English, European and
American readers had admired the novel
before they thought of inquiring who the
writer was or whence he came. It is true
that the story attracted a good deal of
interest in Australia even during its first
appearance as a serial, but from elsewhere
came its recognition as one of the novels of
the century.</p>

<p>The authors whose lives and writings are
briefly sketched in this volume are all noted
in some degree for accuracy and sincerity
<a name="png.023" id="png.023"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">19</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>in their representation of life in Australia.
They have all written from abundant knowledge&mdash;from
love, also, perhaps it may be
added&mdash;of this great wide land with its
brilliant skies, its opportunities and its wholesome
pleasures. That they should fail to
cover their field&mdash;that they tell too much of
country life and adventure and too little of
the throb and energy of the cities&mdash;is in a
large measure explained by the fact that
their books are of necessity primarily written
for English readers.</p>

<p>Somehow it is assumed that people in
the mother-country continue to be interested
only in the picturesque, the curious and
the unusual in Australian life.  The idea
is in part a survival from earlier years
when a host of military officers, Civil Servants,
journalists and tourists described in
some form the more obvious peculiarities of
the colonies: their giant, evergreen forests,
strange amorphous animals, aristocratic gold-diggers,
ex-convicts in carriages, and general
state of topsy-turveydom.  There is quite an
amazing variety of occasional records of this
<a name="png.024" id="png.024"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">20</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>class in forgotten books, magazines and
pamphlets. In at least a score of well-known
novels there are charming country
scenes, true in every particular; but there
is a distinct limit to the power of fiction of
this kind to interest remote readers, while
much repetition of it might well be misleading.</p>

<p>A writer in the <cite>Australasian Critic</cite> once
rightly observed, respecting a batch of short
stories of the conventionally Australian kind,
that English readers might &lsquo;fancy from
them that big cities are unknown in Australia;
that the population consists of
squatters, diggers, stock-riders, shepherds
and bushrangers; that the superior residences
are weatherboard homesteads with
wide verandas, while the inferior ones are huts
and tents.&rsquo; No foreign reader could understand
from them that &lsquo;more than half the
Australian population have never seen kangaroos
or emus outside a zoological garden,
and that not one in a hundred, or even a
thousand, has seen a wild black fellow.&rsquo;
There is a well-known type of Australian
<a name="png.025" id="png.025"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">21</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>novel to which the same remarks might
apply with almost equal fitness.</p>

<p>The lack of interest on the part of the
novelists in the cities is the more noticeable
because they contain one-third of the whole
population of the country, a proportion said
not to have a parallel in any other part of
the world. This neglect is surely a mistake,
founded on an erroneous conception of the
tastes of the English public, and resulting
partly from the absence of anything like a
local literary influence upon the writers.
&lsquo;Have the stress and turmoil of a political
career no charm?&rsquo; asks Mr. Edmund Gosse,
in referring to the restricted scope of the
English novel, and in making a plea for &lsquo;a
larger study of life.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The same question might with very good
reason be raised concerning the political
life of Australia, which has been almost
entirely neglected since Mrs. Campbell Praed
used up the best of her early impressions
and settled in England. The majority of
the writers of fiction who continue to live
in the country are women, and possibly
<a name="png.026" id="png.026"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">22</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>not interested in politics; but the chief
reason why the romance is seldom written
of the Cabinet Minister who started life
as a gold-digger or draper&#8217;s assistant, or of
the democratic legislator whose first election
was announced to him through a hole in a
steam-boiler that he was riveting, is to be
found in a belief that it would not be appreciated
in the far-off land whither all Australian
books must go for the sanction of
their existence. Here again the British
reader appears to be misjudged, for has he
not accepted from another direction, and
enjoyed, <cite>Democracy</cite> and <cite>Through One Administration</cite>?
Mrs. Praed, lightly skimming
the surface of Antipodean political life in
two of her stories, has shown it to be not
without humour, nor lacking in the elements
of more serious interest. But she
cannot be said to have exhibited any particular
belief in the political novel, and
none of the more practised among her
colonial contemporaries has ever given it a
trial.</p>

<p>On the main question of a national literature
<a name="png.027" id="png.027"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">23</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>it will perhaps be concluded that
Australia has yet scarcely any need to be
concerned: that not much must be expected
from a civilisation which, though it has been
rapid, began little more than a century ago;
and that the existence of wealth, and the
possibilities of leisure and culture which
wealth affords, cannot produce the same
effect upon art in a new country as in an
old one. The whole matter no doubt is
somewhat difficult of decision. It has been
none the less useful to indicate why so little
of the work already done is the work of
native writers&mdash;why the existence of much
of the best of it may almost be considered
accidental. And while a refusal to take the
trouble of independently judging the worth
of a local artistic product may or may not be
an invariable characteristic of a new country,
it was also right to contradict on the best
available authority the assertion of a &lsquo;prejudice&rsquo;
against the work of Australian
authors.</p>

<p>A portion of the talent that cannot be
absorbed in the already overcrowded ranks
<a name="png.028" id="png.028"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">24</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>of law and medicine might find employment
in building a literature which should have
something of national savour in it, if migration
to England were no longer a condition
of success to those who would make writing
a profession, as migration to New York or
Boston is similarly found to be a necessity to
the young Canadian man or woman of letters.
It need not be wished that the colonial
Governments would do more than they have
done&mdash;certainly not that they would create a
sort of civil pension list, as a section of the
Legislative Assembly of Victoria contemplated
doing ten years ago in discussing a
proposed grant to the family of Marcus
Clarke. But the Universities might extend
their influence, and those who have leisure
might combine to introduce some of the
methods which have helped to create a living
public interest in literature and art in European
countries. In other words, there is
needed an increased sense of responsibility
in the cultured class: those people, among
others, who yearly help to fill the luxurious
ocean steamships on their long journeys to
<a name="png.029" id="png.029"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">25</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the Old World, and who bring back so
singularly little practical enthusiasm for their
own land in the South.</p>

<p>Meanwhile it is encouraging to note the
high promise of the work of some of the
younger writers. Mary Gaunt (Mrs. H.
Lindsay Miller), the daughter of a well-known
Victorian judge, has, in <cite>The Moving
Finger</cite>, raised the short story to an artistic
level hardly approached by any other Australian
writer. And Mrs. Alick Macleod,
author of <cite>An Australian Girl</cite> and <cite>The
Silent Sea</cite>, has given in the former novel&mdash;a
fine story, despite some irregularities of form&mdash;the
most perfect description of the peculiar
natural features of the country ever written.
For the first time the Bush is interpreted as
well as described. In the attitude displayed
in this story towards the fashionable life of
the towns there is habitual impatience and
occasional scorn. The sketches of Mrs.
Anstey Hobbs&#8217; efforts to found a salon, the
flirtations of Mrs. Lee-Travers&mdash;who &lsquo;chose
her admirers to suit her style of dress&rsquo;&mdash;Laurette
Tareling&#8217;s solemn respect for
<a name="png.030" id="png.030"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">26</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Government House, and the generally
satirical view of the &lsquo;incessant mimicking
of other mimicries,&rsquo; are no doubt justified;
they are often decidedly entertaining. But
it would of course be a mistake to accept
all this as more than a partial view of Melbourne
society. The book does not pretend
to deal with it in other than an incidental
manner. Mrs. Macleod&#8217;s studies of character
and often clever dialogue suggest that she
might profitably adapt to the presentation of
Australian life the quiet intensity of Tourguéneff,
or the delicately observant style of
the American critical realists, Henry James,
W. D. Howells and Richard Harding Davis.
And here one wonders whether the Australian
novelists who find so little material in
Sydney and Melbourne have seen what the
new writer, Henry B. Fuller, has done with
the life of modern unromantic Chicago?</p>

<p>According to Mr. Howells, America,
through the medium of its own particular
class of novel, &lsquo;is getting represented with
unexampled fulness.&rsquo; The writers &lsquo;excel in
small pieces with three or four figures,&rsquo; and
<a name="png.031" id="png.031"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">27</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>are able conveniently to dispense with sensationalism&mdash;a
point not yet reached by
Antipodean novelists. &lsquo;Every now and
then,&rsquo; he says, referring to the extreme of
this type, &lsquo;I read a book with perfect comfort
and much exhilaration, whose scenes the
average Englishman would gasp in. Nothing
happens; that is, nobody murders or debauches
anybody else; there is no arson or
pillage of any sort; there is not a ghost, or
a ravening beast, or a hair-breadth escape, or
a shipwreck, or a monster of self-sacrifice, or
a lady five thousand years old in the whole
story; &ldquo;no promenade, no band of music,
nossing!&rdquo; as Mr. Du Maurier&#8217;s Frenchman
said of the meet for a fox-hunt. Yet it is all
alive with the keenest interest for those who
enjoy the study of individual traits and
general conditions as they make themselves
known to American experience.&rsquo; As the
Transatlantic social conditions, of which the
realistic novel with only three or four figures
is understood to be the outcome, are being
more or less repeated in Australia, a similar
literary medium will probably be found best
<a name="png.032" id="png.032"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">28</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>adapted to the portrayal of life there. At
least it may be claimed that there is no lack
of material in the shape of individual traits
which have not yet been suitably described
in any form.</p>

 /></span>MARCUS CLARKE.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the peculiarity of his fitful talents, and in
the character of his best work in fiction&mdash;a
pathetically slender life&#8217;s product&mdash;Marcus
Clarke is still alone in Australian literature.
Others have shown the cheerful, hopeful,
romantic aspects of the new land; he, not
less honestly, but with a more concentrated
and individual view, has pictured some of
the monotony of its half-grown society, the
gloom of its scenery, and the painful realities
of its early penal systems. Reputed only as
a novelist, he possessed besides imagination
some of the higher qualities of the critical
historian. And had his life been prolonged,
he might almost have done for Australian
city life what Thackeray did for the London
of seventy years ago.  He could, at least,
<a name="png.034" id="png.034"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">30</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>have written a novel of manners that would
have credited the people of Australia with
some individuality: such a novel as would
mark the effects which comparative isolation
must produce in a people who are educated
and intelligent beyond the average of the
British race, intensely self-contained and
ambitious, and of whom two-thirds are now
native-born,&mdash;a novel that would have corrected
the too languidly accepted judgments
of omniscient elderly gentlemen, who, after
a few weeks or months spent among the
smallest and most imitative section of Antipodean
society, gravely conclude that &lsquo;leaves
that grow on one branch of an oak are not
more like leaves that grow upon another,
than the Australian swarm is like the hive
it sprang from.&rsquo;</p>

<p>A rhetorical half-truth of this kind, as
applied to the entire people, can best be
answered in the manner of the modern
realists. The field is narrow in Australia,
yet not too narrow for the writer who, foregoing
the taste for sensation, will be content
to transcribe and interpret impressions of
<a name="png.035" id="png.035"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">31</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the moving humanity around him to their
minutest detail; who will forget the pioneer
squatter, the Oxford scholar disguised as a
&lsquo;rouseabout,&rsquo; and the digger and bushranger
of a past generation; who will sacrifice
something of dramatic effect in the endeavour
to produce a faithful and finished picture of
colonial middle-class society. As qualifications
for such work, Clarke had exceptional
courage, straightness of eye, and a decided
taste for exposing shams, superadded to a
forcible and satirical style of expression.</p>

<p>Whether he had the tact and temperate
spirit that must form the basis of these
qualities in the production of serious fiction
is less certain, if he may be judged by the
tone of such minor pieces as <cite>Civilization
without Delusion</cite>, <cite>Beaconsfield&#8217;s Novels</cite>, and
<cite>Democratic Snobbery</cite>. There is a certain
violence in these which is more offensive than
their undoubted cleverness is admirable or
their satire entertaining. They show that the
writer retained some of the impetuosity and
prejudices which were marked features of his
youth.</p>

<p><a name="png.036" id="png.036"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">32</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Clarke was an anti-Semite, therefore in
the Beaconsfield novels he saw little beyond
an expression of the author&#8217;s personal exultation
as the successful representative
of a maligned race. In the theological
controversy of <cite>Civilization without Delusion</cite>,
an even less effective and becoming performance,
the young author revealed a deficiency
which, in any writer, can only be
regarded as a misfortune and a cause for
tolerant regret. The spiritual side of his
nature was an undeveloped, almost a barren
field. Neglected in boyhood and sapped by
early habits of dissipation, it had no strength
to resist the agnostic conclusions which were
the product in later years of a coldly critical
examination of the general grounds of Christian
belief.</p>

<p>In dealing with religion, his characteristic
independence developed into a stiff intellectual
pride, and from that into a recklessness
which disregarded alike his public
reputation and the feelings of others. But
these forays into the preserves of theology
were happily rare.  Such questions obtained
<a name="png.037" id="png.037"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">33</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>no permanent place in his thoughts: they
were only the passing expression of an ever-besetting
mental restlessness. It is indeed<!-- TN: original reads "indeed," -->
surprising that a writer with artistic instinct
and a sense of humour should ever have persuaded
himself to enter the fruitless field of
religious contention at all.</p>

<p>There are a few facts in the early life
of Marcus Clarke which are sometimes so
strongly, and even painfully, reflected in his
brief career that they form a necessary preface
to any consideration of his literary work.
Soon after his birth at Kensington (London)
in 1846 his mother died, and thenceforward
through all his youth he seems to have received
little advice or attention from relations.
His father, a barrister and literary
man of retired and eccentric habits, exercised
over him a merely nominal authority, and so
he had liberty to gratify a spirit of inquiry
and curiosity notably beyond his years. At
his own home he became the pet of his
father&#8217;s acquaintances, a set of fashionable
cynics.</p>

<p>In <cite>Human Repetends</cite>, a sketch of his
<a name="png.038" id="png.038"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">34</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>published several years later, there is a
passage which substantially records his experiences
at this time: &lsquo;I was thrown, when
still a boy, into the society of men thrice my
age, and was tolerated as a clever impertinent
in all those wicked and witty circles in which
virtuous women are conspicuous by their
absence&hellip;. I was suffered at sixteen to
ape the vices of sixty&hellip;. So long as I
was reported to be moving only in that set
to which my father chose to ally himself, he
never cared to inquire how I spent the extravagant
allowance which his indifference,
rather than his generosity, permitted me to
waste. You can guess the result of such a
training.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Left alone in the world at the age of
eighteen, upon the death of his father, he
emigrated to Australia. Failing to take any
interest in a bank-clerkship provided by an
uncle for him at Melbourne, he was sent to
a sheep-station near Glenorchy, one hundred
miles inland. Here again he paid little
attention to the occupation chosen for him.
All the day and half the night were dreamed
<a name="png.039" id="png.039"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">35</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>away in literary thought. Just as he
wandered alone over fern-hill and creek-bed,
plain and mountain range, and absorbed
impressions of a scenery at once repulsive
and fascinating to him, so he dipped into all
kinds of literature without method or set
purpose. But he preferred fiction, and as
the consignee of an endless succession of
French novels he became a marked man in
the eyes of the village postmaster.</p>

<p>Two years had thus been spent, when
a Dr. Lewins, who was known as a
&lsquo;materialistic philosopher,&rsquo; visited the station
and made the young Englishman&#8217;s acquaintance.
A warm mutual regard resulted, and
soon Lewins succeeded in obtaining a small
post for Clarke on the Melbourne <cite>Argus</cite>.
This was the beginning of the most brilliant
journalistic career established on the Australian
press.</p>

<p>A less happy result of the same friendship
was Clarke&#8217;s conversion to the arid and
uninspiring doctrines of materialism, though
perhaps it could hardly be called a conversion
in the case of one upon whom the deeper
<a name="png.040" id="png.040"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">36</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>principles of Christian faith had never
obtained any real hold.</p>

<p>Colonial democracy seems to have been to
Clarke at once a source of inspiration and of
scorn. Coming from among the English
upper classes, with the education and temperament
of an aristocrat, he was yet readily able
to sympathise with the higher principles of
the new society. Its intelligence, virility
and free intercourse broadened and interested
him, as it does most young Englishmen. But
for that common product of a new country,
the pretentious plutocrat, he had only contempt.</p>

<p>It is the bitterness with which this feeling
is expressed in his journalistic writings that
helps to raise a doubt as to his capacity for
work of the best class in fiction. Still, if it
be true, as some of those who were his
friends say, that this occasional work was
seldom much studied, it becomes unreliable
as an indicator of the writer&#8217;s character. The
same hand that in the famous <cite>Snob Papers</cite>
so savagely, and in at least one case so
intemperately, satirised types of English
<a name="png.041" id="png.041"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">37</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>society, afterwards produced novels in which
fidelity to the essential facts of life is the
most conspicuous quality. So, too, might it
have been in the case of the &lsquo;Peripatetic
Philosopher,&rsquo; whose weekly criticisms of
Melbourne men and manners in 1867-68 has
correctly been judged the best writing of its
kind yet done in Australia. In these articles,
remarkable as the work of one who was only
in his twenty-second year, there is a closeness
of observation and incisiveness of style which
promised much more for their author than
the circumstances of his life afterwards permitted
him to realise.</p>

<p>The usual effects of an undirected youth
and an undisciplined manhood explain Marcus
Clarke&#8217;s failure to render to his adopted
country the service which, as a distinctly
gifted writer of the realist school, he seemed
well fitted to perform. He was a Bohemian,
who, while resisting the worst vices of his
class, shared its carelessness and improvidence
to a degree that left little energy for ambitious
work.</p>

<p>His was not an idle nature by any means:
<a name="png.042" id="png.042"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">38</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>it was only erratic, fond of variety, impatient
of drudgery. Thus, in the course of fourteen
years&#8217; literary work, his thoughts make excursions
from town-life to country-life, from
social satire to story-telling, from art to
ethnology, from theology to opera-bouffe!
Here are the titles of a few of his compositions:
<cite>Lower Bohemia in Melbourne</cite> (a
sketch), <cite>Plot</cite> (a sensational drama), <cite>Review
of Comte and Positive Philosophy</cite> (magazine
article), <cite>The Humbug Papers</cite> (humorous and
satirical), <cite>The Future Australian Race</cite> (an
ethnological study), <cite>Goody Two Shoes</cite> (a
pantomime), <cite>Civilization without Delusion</cite>
(a theological discussion with the Bishop of
Melbourne), <cite>The Power of Love</cite> (an extravaganza),
<cite>Doré and Modern Art</cite> (a review),
<cite>Cannabis Indica</cite> (a psychological experiment).
Almost the whole of Clarke&#8217;s life may be said
to have been devoted to the supply of some
temporary demand of the periodical press or
the stage. Even the two novels which represent
his only sustained work were written
for serial issue in Melbourne magazines.</p>

<p>It does not appear in either case that he
<a name="png.043" id="png.043"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">39</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>wrote with any special view to establish a
literary reputation; indeed, it would seem
that the story of convict life might not have
been completed but for the strenuous importunity
of the firm of publishers with whom
he had contracted to write it.</p>

<p>Journalism, the early occupation of so
many eminent men of letters, has usually
been abandoned as soon as the young writer
has once shown exceptional ability as a
novelist. This rule was not followed by
Clarke. As the leader in his day of the
journalistic class, who, as the late Mr.
Francis Adams has said with substantial
truth, still &lsquo;stand almost entirely for the
conscious literary culture of the whole
Antipodean community,&rsquo; he held a position
which would have unfavourably affected the
literary tone and ambition of a still more
energetic and original writer.</p>

<p>He had no predecessors in the special
work he elected to do; he had to establish
his own standard of achievement; and he
was without the constant stimulus which
intercourse with literary society, such as that
<a name="png.044" id="png.044"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">40</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>of London, affords. The demands of the
newspapers were then, as now, more for
purely ephemeral criticism or narrative than
for matter worthy to rank as permanent
literature.</p>

<p>An alert, pithy style and a distinct gift of
satirical humour such as Clarke had, and
developed by a wide range of reading, were
just the qualities which are always in request
on the keen, aggressive daily press of
Australia. One can easily imagine the
flattering demands made upon the young
author&#8217;s powers by the men who were his
personal friends as well as employers.</p>

<p>Whenever he was deficient in taste of
expression, or in urbanity of criticism (as in
his treatment of the Jews), he showed the
effects partly of impetuous haste, and partly
of his remoteness from those centres of
literary opinion which always beneficially
influence a young writer, be he ever so
original or naturally artistic. It has been
doubted whether Clarke was ever fully
convinced of his own powers; but however
feasibly this may have applied to the first
<a name="png.045" id="png.045"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">41</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>four or five years of his literary career, there
was no ground for it after the unanimously
favourable reception accorded to <cite>For the
Term of his Natural Life</cite> upon its issue in
book form in 1874.</p>

<p>In England and America, as well as in
Australia, this one novel gave him an
immediate and distinct reputation. With
it he might have speedily established himself
as one of the leading writers of the day,
and, turning from the depressing realism of
penal cruelties which can have no further
parallel in British countries to something
more within our sympathies&mdash;to the realism
of modern Australian life,&mdash;have supplied
what is still conspicuously lacking in Australian
fiction. Yet, during the remaining seven
years of his life he produced no imaginative
work worthy his name and ability. The
ever-ready market of the local newspaper
press absorbed his best efforts, and such
intervals as there were he devoted to an
attempt to establish himself as a writer and
adapter for the stage.</p>

<p>In this way the years passed without
<a name="png.046" id="png.046"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">42</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>yielding much beyond a livelihood. Meantime,
Melbourne was his microcosm: he
made a systematic study of its life from the
purlieus of Little Bourke and Lonsdale
streets to the palace of his &lsquo;model legislator&rsquo;
on Eastern Hill. Like Balzac, one
of his favourite novelists, he made observation
a severe and regular business, but he
lacked the energy or the patience to take
full advantage of its results. Balzac employed
his accumulated materials in bursts
of creative energy which, if terrible in their
intensity and their drain upon his health,
had at least method in them, and effected
their purpose. Poverty did not swerve him,
nor prosperity sate him.</p>

<p>That part of genius which consists in natural
depth and accuracy of vision Clarke had in
abundance, but he was weak in the lesser
gifts of patience and synthetic power, perhaps
also in ambition. Moreover, an unfortunate
extravagance, which led from chronic debt
to bankruptcy, compelled him to continue
the class of work which gave the surest and
most regular income.</p>

<p><a name="png.047" id="png.047"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">43</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Repeated requests by the Messrs. Bentley
for more fiction were neglected from year to
year, and similar indifference was shown to
a flattering invitation to join the staff of the
<cite>Daily Telegraph</cite> in London, an opportunity
that would have led to the establishment of
Clarke in those literary circles outside of
which no purely Australian writer, with the
exception of Rolf Boldrewood, has ever yet
received adequate recognition.</p>

<p>Among Clarke&#8217;s uncompleted writings are
a few brilliant chapters of a novel which
promised to be as permanent a record of his
ability as the well-known convict story,
though of a different kind. But the author
had the unlucky faculty of attending to anything
rather than the work which offered him
certain fame and fortune, as well as the most
natural employment of his powers. At the
time of his death he was only in his thirty-fifth
year. Probably with advancing life he
would have become more settled in his tastes
and habits, realising that the work at which
he was happiest in every sense was the
writing of novels, and that alone.</p>

<p><a name="png.048" id="png.048"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">44</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>The satire and cynicism so noticeable in
Clarke&#8217;s writings, especially in his critical
sketches and essays, are liable to give an
inaccurate conception of his temperament.
They obscure, as such characteristics nearly
always do in literature, the gentler aspects of
the writer&#8217;s nature. His satire is, perhaps,
too uncompromising. It often seems to
reflect a personal bitterness, to take too
little cognisance of the springs of human
weakness. Undoubtedly brilliant in force
and keenness, it yet too seldom produces the
kind of hearty laugh with which Thackeray
and Swift, for example, relieve their fiercest
scorn. His personal experience of life had
been discouraging. He had sounded its
depths and sipped its pleasures; its rude
facts found him deficient in self-control and
fortitude. He had refused to learn the
common logic of existence.</p>

<p>There is an element of tragedy in the
rapid change which the unhappy circumstances
of his private life wrought in his
temperament. Addressing the disciples of
Mrs. Grundy in an early essay defending
<a name="png.049" id="png.049"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">45</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the Bohemianism of his youth, he tells them
that they are ignorant how easily good spirits,
good digestion, and jolly companions enable
a man to triumph over all the ills that flesh
is heir to. &lsquo;You cannot know,&rsquo; he adds,
&lsquo;what a fund of humour there is in common
life, and how ridiculous one&#8217;s shifts and
strugglings appear when viewed through
Bohemian glass&hellip;. Life seems to you
but as a &ldquo;twice told tale, vexing the dull ear
of a drowsy man&rdquo; seems but as a vale of
tears, a place of mourning, weeping, and
wailing&hellip;. I wish ye had lived for a
while in &ldquo;Austin Friars&rdquo;; it would have
enlarged your hearts, believe me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This was the cheerful philosophy of Clarke
as a young bachelor, after he had spent his
slender patrimony, disappointed the successive
efforts of friends to make a business
man of him, and was about to begin the
earning of a living by his pen. A dozen
years later we see him with developed
talents and a valuable name, but broken in
fortune and spirit, and gloomily anticipating
death months before it came.  The Jew
<a name="png.050" id="png.050"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">46</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>usurers, whose race he despised, had long
been his real masters, and, with a nature
sensitive in the extreme, he writhed in their
bondage.</p>

<p>Improvidence had been not merely an
unhappy incident, as it is in the lives of so
many young men of artistic tastes; it had
overweighted him more or less for years,
and &lsquo;the thoughtless writer of thoughtful
literature,&rsquo; as the author of his biographical
memoir has called him, sank beneath it while
yet at the beginning of a career full of the
brightest promise. The sort of companionship
that pleased his careless youth had
latterly proved unsatisfying, and to some
extent distasteful to him. Its effects upon
his character were so unfavourable that some
who had been his companions in journalism
felt it necessary, after his death, to credit him
with a greater capacity for kindly forbearance
towards humanity than is apparent in the
bulk of his writings.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My friend,&rsquo; says one writer, &lsquo;was one of
those many geniuses who appear to be born
to prove the vast amount of contradictory
<a name="png.051" id="png.051"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">47</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>elements which can exist in the same individual.
In his case these contradictions were
so apparent&mdash;and, if I may use the term,
so contradictory&mdash;that, unless one knew
him, it was impossible to believe what his
nature was. On the one hand, he was
recklessly generous, impulsively partisan,
morbidly sensitive, and highly chivalrous;
on the other, forgetful of obligations, defiantly
antagonistic, unnecessarily caustic, and
affectedly cynical&hellip;. His life was one of
impulse, and the direction of the impulse
depended solely on surrounding circumstances&hellip;.
He has passed from us at an
early age, leaving behind him some enemies
made, perhaps, by his own waywardness;
but he has left many friends, too,&mdash;friends
who loved him for the good that was in
him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In another sketch of the author, his character
is thus summed up: &lsquo;Caustic he was
sometimes, and cynical always; but beneath
there beat a heart of gold&mdash;a heart tender
and pitiful as a woman&#8217;s.&rsquo; This estimate is
amply justified by the power of pathos and
<a name="png.052" id="png.052"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">48</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the often tender analysis of human feeling
in <cite>For the Term of his Natural Life</cite>, however
absent the same qualities may seem in
many of the shorter stories.</p>

<p>An interesting picture of Clarke&#8217;s personality
is given by a writer in the Sydney
<cite>Bulletin</cite>: &lsquo;His wit was keen and polished,
his humour delicate and refined, and his
powers of description masterly&hellip;. His
face was a remarkable one&mdash;remarkable for
its singular beauty. Like Coleridge, the
poet, he was &ldquo;a noticeable man with large
grey eyes,&rdquo; and one had but to look into
them to perceive at once the light of genius&hellip;.
He was one of the best talkers I have
ever met. Like Charles Lamb, he had a
stutter which seemed to emphasise and add
point to his witticisms. As in his writings,
he had the knack of saying brilliant things,
and scattering <i>bons mots</i> with apparent ease,
so that in listening to him one felt the
pleasure that is derived from such books as
Horace Walpole&#8217;s correspondence and those
of the French memoir-writers&hellip;. He knew
not how to care for money, yet he had none
<a name="png.053" id="png.053"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">49</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>of those vices which ordinarily reduce men
of genius to destitution, and are cloaked
beneath the hackneyed phrase, &ldquo;He had no
enemy but himself.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>In all his journalistic criticism, Marcus
Clarke scarcely more than pointed to the
material which the life of such cities as
Melbourne and Sydney offer a novelist
capable of work like that of Mr. W. D.
Howells, or the series of tales of urban
society in America by Mr. Marion Crawford.
There is now an opportunity, and, one might
almost say, a need, for fiction which shall
also, in effect, be salutary criticism. The
Antipodes have lately illustrated the fact
that a single decade will sometimes witness
a notable change in the conditions of an
entire people in a new and rapidly-developing
country.</p>

<p>Thus, with the struggle for subsistence
now keen to a degree which could not have
been foretold by the gloomiest pessimist a
few years ago; with Parliaments, hitherto
safely democratic, threatened with Socialism
by the increasing practice of electing artisans
<a name="png.054" id="png.054"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">50</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>and labourers to do the legislative work of
their respective classes; the crash of fortunes
which never had substantial existence; the
pauperising to-day of the paper millionaire
of yesterday; the spectacle of worn, old
men, after overreaching and ruining themselves,
starting pitifully the race of life afresh,
a sinister experience their sole advantage
over the faltering novice; and that other
common spectacle of democratic life, the
secure and cultured rich cynically eschewing
the active business of government,&mdash;with
these and some social aspects still less agree
able to contemplate there is ample subject-matter
for any novelist who may have the
disposition and ability to carry on the work
which Clarke had indicated, but scarcely
begun, before he died.</p>

<p><cite>Long Odds</cite>, Clarke&#8217;s first story, deals
with English life, and bears no resemblance
in quality or kind to the later novel with
which his name is chiefly associated. It is
primarily the tragedy of a <i>mésalliance</i>, and
horseracing and politics assist the plot, with
the usual complications of gambling and
<a name="png.055" id="png.055"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">51</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>intrigue. The story has, however, a good
deal less to do with sport than the title
suggests. The plot is mainly concerned
with the selfish, cruel, and infamous in
human nature&mdash;a singularly dark theme for
a young beginner in fiction to choose.
Except at rare intervals when the business
of characterisation is momentarily set aside,
as in the vivid descriptions of the Kirkminster
Steeplechase and the Matcham Hunt,
there is little suggestion of youthful spirit or
freshness.</p>

<p>The outlines of plot and incident are
attractively arranged, the expression of life
for the most part second-hand and artificial.
There are traces of Dickens&#8217; burlesque without
his sympathy, and the high colouring
of Lytton with less than Lytton&#8217;s wit.
Disraeli&#8217;s satire, too, is echoed in the political
scenes. The young Australian squatter, whose
experiences in England were to have formed
the main purpose of the book, is allowed no
opportunity to show the better, and rarely
even the ordinary, capabilities of the new
race of which he is ostensibly a type.</p>

<p><a name="png.056" id="png.056"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">52</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>It is said to be a well-understood maxim
of the novelist&#8217;s art that many a liberty taken
with hero or heroine, or both, is forgiven if
the writer keeps a constant eye upon his
villain, and deals honestly by him. In <cite>Long
Odds</cite> there are two villains, and at least two
others villainously inclined. Between the
four of them the easy-going hero has no
chance.</p>

<p>It is natural that, in the construction of a
novel which aims at dramatic point before
anything else, the &lsquo;simple Australian,&rsquo; as his
author is at last constrained to regard him,
should seem less useful than the polished
and unprincipled man of the world. But in
this instance the balance of interest is too
unequal. Dramatic quality has been secured
at the expense of tone and proportion. Of
the two male characters whose exploits in
rascality it becomes the real business of the
story to tell, Rupert Dacre is the more
natural and entertaining.</p>

<p>There is an attention to detail in his
portrait which suggests that the lineaments
of the conventional society villain may have
<a name="png.057" id="png.057"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">53</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>been filled in with the help of a little personal
knowledge, perhaps of some of those morally
doubtful individuals already mentioned as
having been among the acquaintances of
Clarke&#8217;s early youth. Dacre is the chief
cynic of the story, and to him are assigned
the best of the dialogue and all of the small
stock of humour to be found in the novel.
But the man who is both his associate and
enemy, Cyril Chatteris, is a common sort of
dastard, and altogether disagreeable.</p>

<p>The author is not entirely forgetful of the
interests of his nominal hero. If throughout
three-fourths of the story Calverley is made
the plaything of circumstances that favour
only rogues, he is at last allowed a triumph
in love and sport which, though unsatisfying
from an artistic point of view, is calculated
to soothe a not too fastidious taste for poetic
justice.</p>

<p>Conscious of the conventional character of
his principal theme, the author apparently
sought to improve it by deepening its intensity.
The result of this was to add more
of weakness than of strength. Incidents
<a name="png.058" id="png.058"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">54</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>that might have been effectively dramatic
become melodramatic; the conceivably probable
is sometimes strained into the
obviously improbable. The agreeable finish
to the minor love-story of Calverley and
Miss Ffrench does not remove the general
savour of sordidness which the reader carries
away from the study of so much of the bad
side of human nature.</p>

<p>In connection with criticism of this kind,
it ought, however, to be noted that other
hands besides the author&#8217;s are known to have
contributed to the novel. Shortly after it
began to appear serially in the <cite>Colonial
Monthly</cite>, Marcus Clarke fell from a horse
while hunting, and sustained a fracture of the
skull which interrupted his literary work for
many weeks. How much of the writing had
previously been done seems to be a subject
of dispute. It is, however, quite clear that, in
order to preserve continuity in the publication
of the parts, Clarke&#8217;s friends did write some
portion of the story, but whether in accordance
with the author&#8217;s <i>scenario</i>, supposing
one to have existed, has not been stated.</p>

<p><a name="png.059" id="png.059"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">55</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;Only a few of the first chapters&#8217; were
the work of Clarke, says the editor of the
<cite>Marcus Clarke Memorial Volume</cite>, writing
in 1884; but in an article published in the
<cite>Imperial Review</cite> (Melbourne) for 1886, the
contributed matter is limited to a couple of
chapters written by Mr. G. A. Walstab, and
skilfully inserted in the middle of the novel.
Walstab was one of Clarke&#8217;s best friends, and
he is no doubt the &lsquo;G.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;W.&rsquo; to whom the
story is dedicated &lsquo;in grateful remembrance
of the months of July and August, 1868.&rsquo;</p>

<p>From the absence of a prefatory explanation
when <cite>Long Odds</cite> was published in
book form in 1869, it may be assumed that
Clarke was satisfied with the quality of the
contributed work. At least, he was willing
to take the full responsibility of its authorship.
But even with this in view, it were
well, perhaps, not to hold him too strictly
accountable for the faults of the story. Not
much must be expected from a first novel
produced in the circumstances mentioned, and
issued when the author was only twenty-three.
In his haste to give it final shape
<a name="png.060" id="png.060"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">56</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>immediately after the serial publication, he
was probably ill advised. One can only
regret that it was not set aside for a year or
so, and written afresh, or, at least, largely
revised. Perhaps this would have been expecting
too much from so unmethodical a
worker as Clarke. The far finer dramatic
taste and literary form of his masterpiece,
issued five years later, showed how little
indicative of his talent was the earlier
work.</p>

<p>In view of the large extent to which the
life of the Australian landed classes has been
described in fiction during the last twenty
years, it is curious to read the plea Clarke
offered to his Antipodean critics for passing
over the literary material close at hand and
preferring the well-worn paths of the English
novelist.</p>

<p>During the serial publication of <cite>Long
Odds</cite> the colonial press raised some objection
to the laying of the scene in England
instead of in Australia. The author replied
simply that Henry Kingsley&#8217;s <cite>Geoffry
Hamlyn</cite> being the best Australian novel
<a name="png.061" id="png.061"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">57</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>that had been, or probably would be, written,
&lsquo;any attempt to paint the ordinary squatting
life of the colonies could not fail to challenge
unfavourable comparison with that admirable
story.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The excuse is just a little too adventitious
to have convinced even those to whom it was
originally addressed. None the less, it may
at the moment have accurately represented
the opinion of a beginner who at that time
could scarcely have known the extent of his
own powers.</p>

<p>Probably he had given the subject little
thought. His colonial experience was certainly
less varied than Kingsley&#8217;s had been.
Above all, his tastes, and in some degree his
temperament, differed markedly from those
of his predecessor in the field. The judgment
or instinct that kept him from coming
into direct competition with Kingsley&mdash;assuming
his own questionable belief that
any effort of his would have been competition&mdash;at
least erred on the side of safety.
That the immediate alternative should have
been an imitative example of a hackneyed
<a name="png.062" id="png.062"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">58</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>class of English novel, ineffective of purpose,
book-inspired, and tainted with the deadness
of cynicism, is something which admits of a
more definite opinion.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have often thought,&rsquo; says the writer,
referring to the hero of <cite>Geoffry Hamlyn</cite>
&lsquo;and I dare say other Australian readers
have thought also, How would Sam Buckley
get on in England? My excuse, therefore,
in offering to the Australian public a novel
in which the plot, the sympathies, the interest,
and the moral, are all English, must
be that I have endeavoured to depict with
such skill as is permitted to me the fortunes
of a young Australian in that country which
young Australians still call &ldquo;Home.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Without this prefatory sign-post, the reader
could never have suspected such a purpose.
Clarke may have had it definitely in his mind
when he first sat down to the work; but if
so, it was put aside, consciously or unconsciously,
after the completion of the first few
chapters, in favour of more complex characterisation.
Bob Calverley, the young
squatter, really holds a third or fourth place
<a name="png.063" id="png.063"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">59</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>in relation to the main motive of the story,
and is used rather as a foil than as an exemplar
of anything typically Australian. He
does not bear any active part in the drama
of passion and intrigue; he is not even permitted
to be a passive spectator of it.</p>

<p>To say that he was good-natured, jovial,
popular, &lsquo;the sort of man that one involuntarily
addresses by his Christian name&rsquo;; that
although he was shy and awkward in the
society of ladies, at ease with his own sex
only when cattle and horses were the subject
of conversation, ignorant of music, and unable
to tell Millais from Tenniel, he &lsquo;could
pick you out any bullock in a herd &hellip; shear
a hundred sheep a day &hellip; and drive four
horses down a sidling in a Gippsland range
with any man in Australia,&rsquo;&mdash;to say all this
by way of preliminary, to add that Calverley
was no fool, and yet to show him in scarcely
any other guise than that of a trusting victim
of rogues, is to go a very short distance in
the portrayal of a typical Australian.</p>

<p>In the slack-baked condition in which we
find him, he merely repeats the ordinary
<a name="png.064" id="png.064"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">60</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>spectacle of green youth in the process of
seeing life and buying experience at the
usual high figure. Compared with the real
squatter (who, ordinarily, is college-trained,
and does not shear sheep nor risk his neck
unnecessarily), Bob, the son of rich &lsquo;Old
Calverley,&rsquo; and nephew of an English baronet,
is as an exaggerated stock-figure of the stage
to the commonplace blood and brain of everyday
life. A childlike trust in one&#8217;s fellows,
a reputation for good-nature, an untamable<!-- TN: sic -->
taste for horseflesh and the pursuits of the
Bush, belong to every young squatter in a
certain class of Australian fiction; they are
qualities which may be applied indiscriminately,
with always some effect.</p>

<p>The real squatter is a more civilised and
reliable, if less picturesque, person. He
likes both work and pleasure, provided they
be suitably proportioned. His work is in
the personal management of his properties;
his pleasure is taken in the large cities.
He entertains no fantastic prejudices against
urban life, in proof of which he often spends
his later years in some city hundreds of miles
<a name="png.065" id="png.065"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">61</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>from the scene of his early toil and pastoral
successes.</p>

<p>As a young man in London, he can be
found with rooms at the Langham, the
Métropole, or some other of the half-dozen
fashionable hotels known to colonial visitors.
There he will entertain his friends, joining
with them, in turn, the continuous movements
of the society season. He frankly
lacks much of the ease and polish of the
young Englishman, but his natural amiability
and good spirits largely compensate for these
deficiencies, while they preclude any feeling
of discomfort on his own part.</p>

<p>During his three or six months&#8217; stay in
London (the combination usually of a little
business with a very full programme of
pleasure) he spends freely, and in his tour
of the clubs plays here and there a little at
cards&mdash;perchance loses. Worldly beyond his
reputation, and somewhat Chesterfieldian in
his principles, he consents to be a Roman
while at Rome. He has inherited the British
hatred of fuss and personal peculiarity, and
none shall call him mean. But, unlike many
<a name="png.066" id="png.066"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">62</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>of his English friends at club and course, he
has watched and taken some part in the hard
process of making money, and knows the
difference between a little gentlemanly extravagance
and the reckless hazarding of a
fortune. At least, it may be affirmed of him
that in nine cases out of ten he is decidedly
no fool.</p>

<p>These are only a few of the prominent
outlines of the type of young man who, his
holiday over, returns unspoiled to work on
his own or his father&#8217;s estates. Those whose
passion for a horse destroys all self-control,
who spend thousands in gambling and betting,
who innocently take every smooth gentleman
at his own valuation, are merely individuals&mdash;persons
who may as unfailingly be found
in England or elsewhere as in Australia.</p>

<p>Sam Buckley is a typical descendant of
the British pioneer colonists, as every Australian
knows. In attempting to give an
answer to his own speculation of &lsquo;How would
Sam Buckley get on in England?&rsquo; Clarke
presumably undertook to continue the portrayal
of this type. The result, considered
<a name="png.067" id="png.067"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">63</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>apart from the function Calverley fulfils in
<cite>Long Odds</cite>, must be held as emphatically a
failure.</p>

<p>Never was a novel written with a franker
or more deliberate purpose than that shown
in <cite>For the Term of his Natural Life</cite>. The
author had the twofold object of picturing
the dreadful crudities and brutalities of the
early system of convict &lsquo;reformation&rsquo; in
Australia, and of preventing their possible
repetition elsewhere. The first of these aims
was attained with a fuller employment, and
perhaps more moderate statement of historical
facts, than can be found in any other fiction of
the same class; the second was ineffective,
because, when it found expression, the abuses
which had suggested it no longer continued
at the Antipodes, and could not conceivably
be repeated on the existing settlements at
Port Blair and Noumea.</p>

<p>The story was written a quarter of a
century too late to assist the abolition of
convict transportation to Australia. Had it
appeared at the right time, it might have
done much where formal inquiries and the
<a name="png.068" id="png.068"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">64</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>testimonies of disinterested and humane
observers had repeatedly failed. For sixty
years the practice of deporting criminals had
been carried on, upheld in England by
official indifference and callousness, and in
the colonies themselves by the greed of a
small class of private persons who grew
rapidly wealthy upon the strength of assigned
convict labour, until the free emigrants by
the authority of their numbers were able to
insist upon its cessation. For so long as the
colonies were willing to receive a population
of criminals, so long was England only too
anxious to supply them and make a virtue
out of it. It mattered little to the official
mind that the system was incurably bad and
immoral; the main thing was to speedily and
effectually transfer an awkward burden to
other shoulders. The entire history of penal
transportation from Great Britain throws a
sinister light upon the national character.
The practice originated with banishment of
convicts to the American colonies under
conditions which constituted a form of
slavery.</p>

<p><a name="png.069" id="png.069"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">65</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>The criminal on being sentenced became a
marketable chattel of the State. His services
were sold by public auction, the purchaser
acquiring the right to transport him and sell
him for the term of his sentence to a builder,
planter, manufacturer, or other employer
beyond the Atlantic. The price paid to the
British Government averaged five pounds per
head, and some of the more useful prisoners
were resold in America for twenty-five
pounds each. One of these dealers in
convict labour, in giving evidence before a
committee of the House of Commons, made
a matter-of-fact complaint that &lsquo;the trade&rsquo;
was not so remunerative as people supposed.
Artisans sold well, but the profit realised
upon them was often consumed by losses
upon some of the others. One-seventh of his
purchases died on his hands, and in the course
of business he had been obliged to give the
old, the halt and the lame in for nothing.
When the War of Independence closed the
United States against the traffic, Britain
was given a fresh opportunity to reconsider
and place its penal system upon a more
<a name="png.070" id="png.070"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">66</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>humane basis; but the temptation to adopt
sweeping measures was once more too strong
to be resisted. The promoters of the
Australian scheme were in so great a hurry
to seize their chance that they despatched
over seven hundred convicts before even the
site for the first settlement was chosen. The
hardships which this characteristic act afterwards
entailed are too familiar in history to
need repetition. After such recklessness, it is
no wonder that, as Sir Roger Therry has
observed, &lsquo;the first-fruits of the system
exhibited a state of society in New South
Wales which the world might be challenged
to surpass in depravity.&rsquo;</p>

<p>A generation passed before the British
Government reluctantly admitted transportation
to be a failure. Lord John Russell, as
late as 1847, discovered that it had been
&lsquo;too much the custom to consult the convenience
of Great Britain by getting rid of
persons of evil habits, and to take that view
alone.&rsquo; In planting provinces which might
become empires, they &lsquo;should endeavour to
make them, not seats of malefactors and
<a name="png.071" id="png.071"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">67</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>convicts, but communities which may set
examples of virtue and happiness.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This mild, platitudinous rebuke came
when all the damage was done. It remained
for the free inhabitants of Australia to point
to a plainer principle in declaring that &lsquo;the
inundating of feeble and dependent colonies
with the criminals of the parent State is
opposed to that arrangement of Providence
by which the virtue of each community is
destined to combat its own vice.&rsquo;</p>

<p>To illustrate in a single story all the most
prominent and pernicious features of the
transportation system, Clarke had to invent
a case of crime in which the criminal, unlike
the majority of the worst offenders sent to
the settlements, should always be worthy of
the reader&#8217;s sympathy. It was necessary
that the felon be a victim as well as a felon;
that he should not regain his liberty in any
form, but continue by a series of offences
against the authority of his gaolers to experience
and display all the successive
severities of Macquarie Harbour, Port
Arthur, and Norfolk Island. A fundamental
<a name="png.072" id="png.072"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">68</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>fact to be exhibited was the impassable gulf
of misunderstanding that might exist between
capricious or incompetent prison officials and
a criminal who, for any reason, had once
come to be regarded as hopelessly vicious.
&lsquo;We must treat brutes like brutes,&rsquo; says the
prime martinet of the story: &lsquo;keep &#8217;em
down, sir; make &#8217;em <em>feel</em> what they are.
They&#8217;re here to work, sir. If they won&#8217;t
work, flog &#8217;em until they will. If they work&mdash;why,
a taste of the cat now and then keeps
&#8217;em in mind of what they may expect if they
get lazy.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The author chose to represent the extreme
case of a man who, innocent of a murder
charged against him, allowed himself to be
transported under an assumed name in order
to prevent the exposure of a long-concealed
act of unfaithfulness on the part of a beloved
mother.</p>

<p>Richard Devine is the bastard son of an
aristocratic Englishwoman who in early youth
was forced by her father into a loveless union
with a rich plebeian. The single fault of the
mother&#8217;s life is confessed after twenty years,
<a name="png.073" id="png.073"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">69</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>when the husband in a moment of anger
strikes her high-spirited and obstinate son.
The latter consents to leave his home for
ever, and relinquish the name he has borne.
On these terms the wife is spared. Richard
Devine goes on the instant. Crossing
Hampstead Heath, he comes upon a robbed
and murdered man, and presently is arrested
for the crime. The explanation that would
save him would also cause the dreaded
exposure of his mother, and so he withholds
it, gives a false name, and, having put himself
beyond the means of defence and the
recognition of friends, is convicted and
sentenced to transportation for life.</p>

<p>In making all the subsequent career of
Rufus Dawes abnormally painful&mdash;that of a
dumb sufferer who in sixteen years&#8217; confinement,
ending only in a tragic death, experiences
by turns every form of punishment
and oppression&mdash;the author often touches,
though it cannot be said he ever exceeds,
the limits of possibility.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Need one who was not a hardened
criminal have suffered so much and so long?&rsquo;
<a name="png.074" id="png.074"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">70</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>is the question that continually recurs to the
mind of the reader; but it is suggested by
the prolonged and pitiful sense of unsatisfied
justice rather than by any doubting that the
extremes of penal discipline as practised in
the name of the British Government between
forty and sixty years ago could have been
successively applied to a single human being.
The writer adheres relentlessly to his central
idea to the end. Dawes&#8217; unameliorated
servitude and unavenged fate were intended
to symbolise glaring anomalies of justice
which never were remedied. The &lsquo;correction&rsquo;
he is subjected to was that which the
laws of the time permitted, and which in
many cases goaded its victims to draw lots
to murder one another in order to escape
from their misery.</p>

<p>Some of the least creditable features of
convict transportation, of which it was said
by Earl Grey in 1857 that their existence
had been a disgrace to the nation, came to
an end only when the system itself was
abolished. But novelist and statesman alike
struck at the abuses without feeling it necessary
<a name="png.075" id="png.075"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">71</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>to mention any of the good results of
the system. Its inherent merits were strictly
few, indeed; yet they ought to be sought in
history by anyone who would get a fair idea
of the prison policy of the period. It is, of
course, inevitable that the criticism conveyed
in a strong imaginative work should fail to
give a full view of results so complex as
those produced by the largely haphazard
method of the Australian penal settlements.</p>

<p>The practice of assigning prisoners to
private employment, for example, produced
notable effects upon society, of which Marcus
Clarke&#8217;s story gives but the faintest indication.
If Rufus Dawes had been an ordinary first
offender, he might have regained liberty
soon after his arrival in Van Diemen&#8217;s Land.
But, as we have seen, it was the purpose of
the author to make him exhibit all the rigours
of convict discipline. His case must therefore
be regarded as more exceptional than
typical. As a rule, only men inveterate in
crime were detained in constant punishment.
Transportation for life meant servitude only
for eight years if the convict conducted himself
<a name="png.076" id="png.076"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">72</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>well, a condition which, of course, depended
largely on the sort of master who
secured his services. Major de Winton, an
officer who served for some years on Norfolk
Island, has mentioned that a prisoner by
good conduct received a ticket-of-leave after
he had been twice sentenced to death, thrice
to transportation for life, and to cumulative
periods of punishment amounting to over a
hundred years!</p>

<p>An interesting view of Marcus Clarke as a
literary workman is obtained from the story
of the conception and laborious writing of
<cite>For the Term of his Natural Life</cite>. It
affords the first, and unhappily the last,
evidence of how far he recognised the claims
of realism in fiction; and from the account of
his suffering under the self-imposed drudgery
of keeping to the strict line of history, we
see the man as his friends knew him contrasted
with the conscientious artist known
to the general reader of his famous novel.</p>

<p>The best of Clarke&#8217;s minor writings display
the results of much general culture, but give
no proof of special preparation.  They are
<a name="png.077" id="png.077"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">73</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>short, concentrated, forcible&mdash;the natural
expression of a brilliant, impetuous, and
spasmodic worker. He overcame his natural
repugnance to lengthened toil and minute
thoroughness when he saw them to be
essential conditions of his task. But the
effort was a severe one.</p>

<p>In 1871, when about twenty-five years of
age, he was ordered to recruit his health by
a trip to Tasmania. He had been for over
three years writing extensively for the press,
and joining in the gaieties of Melbourne life
at a rate which a constitution much stronger
than his could not have withstood. The
idea of writing a story of prison life had
suggested itself previously during his reading
of Australian history. Finding himself now
without sufficient money for the proposed
holiday, he decided to put into active progress
this literary project which had hitherto
been only vaguely outlined.</p>

<p>Printed records of the convict days there
were in abundance at Melbourne, and from
these alone such a writer could have made a
sufficiently striking story.  But he concluded
<a name="png.078" id="png.078"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">74</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>that he could make his picture at once truer
and more vivid when the surroundings of
the old settlements had become a full reality
to his mind. Messrs. Clarson, Massina and
Co. readily contracted with the young novelist
for the first publication of the story in their
monthly, the <cite>Australian Journal</cite>, and made
him an advance of money. Off he went
with characteristic confidence, and some weeks
later returned ready primed and eager for
the new work. His enthusiasm soon cooled.
The story commenced to appear after the
first few chapters were written, and the unbroken
industry necessary to maintain a
regular supply of the parts was more than
Clarke could give.</p>

<p>Writing against time, he is said to have
felt like a convict himself. The irregular
dribbling out of the story so injured the
reputation of the journal that for a time its
circulation was reduced to one-half the
ordinary issue.</p>

<p>Mr. Hamilton Mackinnon, the writer of a
sympathetic memoir of Clarke, has given an
entertaining account of what followed: &lsquo;The
<a name="png.079" id="png.079"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">75</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>author would be frequently interviewed by
the publishers, and would as frequently
promise the copy. When moral suasion was
apparently powerless to effect the required
object, payments in advance were made with
somewhat better results; but as this could
not go on <i>ad libitum</i>, copy would fall into
arrears again. At last it was found that the
only way to get the author to finish his tale
was to induce him into a room in the
publishing-house, where, under the benign
influences of a pipe, etc., and a lock on the
door, the necessary work would be done by
the facile pen; and in such manner was <cite>His
Natural Life</cite> produced.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In a note of apology to their readers in
January, 1871, the publishers print a somewhat
comical letter which they had received
from the delinquent author. Forwarding a
single chapter of the story, he tells them that
they must make shift with it as best they can,
and he will let them have a larger supply
during the following month. The letter concludes
nonchalantly as follows: &lsquo;This is
awkward, I admit, and I suppose some good-natured
<a name="png.080" id="png.080"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">76</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>friend or other will say that I have
over-plum-puddinged or hot-whiskied myself
in honour of the so-called festive season, but
I can&#8217;t help it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The story as first published was much
longer than the form in which it appears in
the English edition. At the request of the
present writer, Sir Charles Gavan Duffy, who
was one of Clarke&#8217;s literary friends, supplies
the following account of how the novel came
to be so extensively curtailed:</p>

<p>&lsquo;As one of the trustees to the public
library (Melbourne), I saw Clarke constantly,
and had always a friendly, and sometimes
a confidential, conversation with him. He
visited me now and then at Sorrento, and
on one of these occasions he spoke of a
story he had running through a Melbourne
periodical about which he was perplexed.
He asked me to read it, and tell him unreservedly
what I thought of it. I read the
story carefully, making notes on the margin,
and wrote him frankly the impression it had
made on me.</p>

<p>&lsquo;After twenty years I can recall the substance
<a name="png.081" id="png.081"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">77</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>of the letter, which is probably still in
existence. A powerful story, I said, but
painful as it is powerful. The incidents,
instead of being depressing, would be tragic if
they befell anyone we loved or honoured. But
there was no one in the story whom he could
have intended us to love or honour. The
hero underwent a lifelong torture without any
credible, or even intelligible, motive, and on
the whole was a <i>mauvais sujet</i> himself. To
win the reader&#8217;s sympathy, all this must be
altered. I strongly advised that the latter
part of the story, in which the Ballarat outbreak
was described under a leader whom he
named Peter Brawler, should be omitted;
and I objected to the publication of a song
in French <i>argot</i> with a spirited translation,
as the latter would naturally be attributed
to the author of the novel, whereas I had
read it in an early <cite>Blackwood</cite> before he was
born.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Marcus Clarke thanked me warmly, and
said he would adopt all my suggestions. He
wrote a new prologue, in which he made the
protection of his mother&#8217;s good name the
<a name="png.082" id="png.082"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">78</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>motive of the hero&#8217;s silence, and he omitted
both the things I had objected to.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Ending, as it began, with a tragedy, the
artistic unity of the novel is thus preserved,
and the dominant aim of the author
emphasised. Many of those who read it in
the serial parts strongly disapproved of the
excisions, but there can be little doubt that
the story is the stronger for their having been
made.</p>

<p>It was as the work of a vivid historian,
rather than of a social reformer, that Marcus
Clarke&#8217;s masterpiece won its popularity, and,
for its dramatic and substantially accurate
view of the worst (always the worst) aspect
of convict life, it will continue to be read
while anyone remains to take an interest in
the unhappiest period of Australian history.
From its pages may be learned how long it
has taken the intelligent theorist of the
British Government to acquire a practical
method of treating a difficult social question;
how long stupidity and inhumanity may be
practised with the sanction of what Major
Vickers was fond of respectfully calling &lsquo;the
<a name="png.083" id="png.083"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">79</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>King&#8217;s regulations&rsquo;; and how far English
gentlemen, remote from the influence of
public opinion and invested with more power
than single individuals should ever possess,
may become despots, and even blackguards.</p>

<p>It is a grim record. Let those who are
inclined to doubt it turn to the originals,
especially to the report of the House of
Commons Committee of 1837-38, and they
will find facts which the creator of Rufus
Dawes, with all his supple fancy and delicacy
of language, could not bring himself even to
indicate. There are episodes which the more
matter-of-fact historians barely mention, but
do not take advantage of their great privileges
to describe. For example, there were
times during the first thirty years of the
century when the open and general lewdness
of the officials on some of the principal
settlements, in their relations with the female
convicts, rendered them totally unfit for the
positions they held.</p>

<p>Clarke in his researches obtained abundant
knowledge of this, but made no use of it
save in adding a few luminous touches to his
<a name="png.084" id="png.084"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">80</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>portrait of Dawes&#8217; passionate and licentious
cousin.</p>

<p>In reading the novel for its historical
interest, it is necessary throughout to remember
the limitation that the writer has
specifically put upon himself. He did not
undertake to illustrate any of the good effects
of exile upon a section of the first offenders
sent to the colonies, and scarcely touches the
travesties of justice so often wrought by that
lottery in human life known as the assignment
system. His purpose is to describe
&lsquo;the dismal condition of a felon during his
term of transportation,&rsquo; and to show the
futility of a prison system loosely planned at
one end of the world and roughly executed
at the other by men who found it easier,
and in some cases more agreeable, to their
undiscerning hearts to coerce than to
ameliorate.</p>

<p>The Parliamentary Committee defined
transportation as &lsquo;a series of punishments
embracing every degree of human suffering,
from the lowest, consisting of a slight
restraint upon freedom of action, to the
<a name="png.085" id="png.085"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">81</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>highest, consisting of long and tedious
torture.&rsquo; It was with the latter part of the
definition in mind that Clarke told his story.
He chose to represent servitude in the
chain-gangs of Van Diemen&#8217;s Land and
Norfolk Island as the condition of slavery
which Sir Richard Bourke and Sir George
Arthur admitted it to be, as the utter failure
described by the experienced Dr. Ullathorne,
and as the system recommended by the
House of Commons Committee to be
abolished as incapable of improvement and
&lsquo;remarkably efficient, not in reforming, but
still further corrupting those who undergo
punishment.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The idea which is the ganglion of Clarke&#8217;s
plot was always seen clearly, but never
obsessed his mind as did a cognate theme
that of the impetuous reformer Charles
Reade. In his crusade against the form of
punishment known as the &lsquo;silent system,&rsquo;
the English novelist obtrudes his moral with
a frequency that weakens the effect of his
often splendid eloquence. The direct opposite
of this style is seen in the Australian novel.
<a name="png.086" id="png.086"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">82</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>The author never openly preaches. His best
effects are obtained by quiet satire conveyed
in the gradual limning of his characters, and
by occasional incidents of which each is
allowed to give its own lesson to the reader.
The facts have all the advantage of a
studiously calm and impersonal presentation.</p>

<p>In the rapid progress of the plot the reader
is kept keenly interested. If he have an eye
for the moral he will detect it at once; if not,
there is no importunate author to force it
upon him. In either case he will find the
story an absorbing one. &lsquo;It has all the
solemn ghastliness of truth,&rsquo; said Lord
Rosebery, writing to the novelist&#8217;s widow
in 1884. He confessed that the book had a
fascination for him. Not once or twice,
but many times, had he read it, and during
his visit to Australia he spent some time in
viewing the scene of the old settlements and
examining the reports upon which the novel
is so largely based.</p>

<p>That there are some exaggerations in the
treatment of facts need hardly be stated, but
they are few in number, not serious in import,
<a name="png.087" id="png.087"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">83</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>and outbalanced by numerous cases in which
it has been necessary to modify the description
of incidents either too painful or horrible to
be fully depicted. As a compensation for its
occasional storical inaccuracy, <cite>His Natural
Life</cite> is notably free of the melodramatic
excesses that most young writers would have
been tempted to commit. Clarke was too
good an artist to think of pleading the
sanction of facts for any misuse of the
privileges of good fiction. To maintain a
strong impression on the reader, his touch is
occasionally strong and fearless, like that of
Kipling. But this object attained, he uses
his materials with an almost unnecessary
reticence. The episode of the cannibalism
of Gabbett and his fellow-convicts is exceptional.
Yet it purposely falls short of the
terrible original, which is happily hidden
away from general view between the covers
of an old Parliamentary report.</p>

<p>It has been said of Clarke, by one of his
friends, that in his estimate of motives he was
invariably cynical. Though the assertion
goes too far, it seems to suggest the best
<a name="png.088" id="png.088"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">84</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>explanation of his notable preference for
delineating the dark side of human nature.
He appeared ever to see vice more clearly,
or at any rate to find it more interesting for
the purposes of fiction, than the good or the
neutral in character. But his cynicism&mdash;if it
really formed a settled feature of his character&mdash;was
not of the kind that implies any indifference
to injustice or dishonesty. In this
particular, both his fiction and essays have no
uncertain tone. It is indeed a fault of Clarke
that his bad characters are in most cases
wholly bad. He makes Frere abandon a
life of debauchery under the influence of a
pure woman&#8217;s affection, but the effect is
afterwards destroyed by evidences that the
attachment on the man&#8217;s side is sensual and
based on vanity. Moreover, Frere the prison
tyrant and base denier of Dawes&#8217; heroism
remains unexcused.</p>

<p>Bob Calverley and Miss Ffrench, the only
important representatives of the ordinary
virtues in <cite>Long Odds</cite>, are little more than
dim shadows contrasted with the clearly-marked
personalities of half a dozen others
<a name="png.089" id="png.089"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">85</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>in the story who are rogues, or the associates
and instruments of rogues. &lsquo;The human
anguish of every page&rsquo; of <cite>His Natural
Life</cite> which Lord Rosebery found so compelling
to his attention, need not have been
so continuous and unqualified.</p>

<p>The author seems purposely to have
ignored the opportunity afforded by the story
for the introduction of a character who, while
asserting the claims of Rufus Dawes and the
broader interests of humanity, need not have
defeated the main motive of the plot. It
was a decided error not to gratify in this
way the combative instinct of the reader.
The Rev. James North&mdash;&lsquo;gentleman, scholar,
and Christian priest&rsquo;&mdash;might have been an
active opponent of cruelty like Eden, the
clergyman in <cite>It&#8217;s Never Too Late to Mend</cite>,
instead of being made a pitiable example of
a confirmed and self-accusing drunkard.</p>

<p>The strength of <cite>His Natural Life</cite> lies
not so much in the ingenuity and dramatic
quality of its plot, as in the number of striking
personalities among its leading characters.
That of Rufus Dawes, curiously, is distinct
<a name="png.090" id="png.090"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">86</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>only at intervals. It represents, for the most
part, a hopeless sufferer passing through a
series of punishments which become almost
monotonous in their unvaried severity.</p>

<p>But what could be more luminous than the
portrait of Sarah Purfoy, the clever, self-possessed
adventuress with the single redeeming
quality of an invincible love for her
worthless and villainous convict-husband? or
that of Frere, the swaggering, red-whiskered,
coarsely good-humoured convict-driver, glorying
in his knowledge of the heights and depths
of criminal ingenuity and vice, and frankly
ignorant of all else?</p>

<p>How naturally from such a person comes
that savagely humorous dissertation upon the
treatment of prisoners! &lsquo;There is a sort of
satisfaction to me, by George! in keeping
the scoundrels in order. I like to see the
fellows&#8217; eyes glint at you as you walk past
&#8217;em. Gad! they&#8217;d tear me to pieces if they
dared, some of &#8217;em.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Frere is a triumph of consistent literary
portraiture. He is generally understood to
have been a study from life.  But as the
<a name="png.091" id="png.091"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">87</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>official whose name has sometimes been associated
with the character was a considerably
more humane disciplinarian than the persecutor
of Rufus Dawes, it must be assumed
that Clarke aimed only at the representation
of a type.</p>

<p>Brutes like Frere and his vindictive associates,
Burgess and Troke, there undoubtedly
were on the settlements, but the average
official has probably a better representative
in Major Vickers, the Commandant. Vickers
is not an unkind man, but does not trust
himself to do anything unprovided for in
the &lsquo;regulations,&rsquo; for which he has an abject
respect. &lsquo;It is not for me to find fault with
the system,&rsquo; he says; &lsquo;but I have sometimes
wondered if kindness would not succeed
better than the chain-gang and the cat.&rsquo;
But he never gives intelligence, much less
kindness, a fair trial.</p>

<p>Sylvia Vickers is the only complete picture
of a good woman to be found in any of the
author&#8217;s stories. Taken in childhood by her
parents to the penal settlements, and separated
there for years from youthful society,
<a name="png.092" id="png.092"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">88</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>familiarised with the constant aspects of
crime and suffering, and habitually in the
society of her elders, she early develops into
a quaint, matter-of-fact little creature, such
as might well disconcert a peacock like the
Reverend Meekin.</p>

<p>To Frere, whose knowledge of other
women has been mainly immoral, her innocence
and wilfulness, and her instinctive
dislike of him, serve as a strong attraction.
Though he becomes her husband by means
of a cruel fraud, he never fully gains her
trust, and the estrangement so tragically
sealed in the last chapter of the novel comes
almost as a relief to the sympathetic reader
of her sad history. Sylvia Vickers, despite
the gloomy environment of her youth, is
throughout an intensely womanly woman,
the delicate conception of whose character
surely places her creator far above the rank
of the cynics in literature.</p>

<p>Not the least of the elements which combine
to make <cite>His Natural Life</cite> one of the
most remarkable novels of the century is the
occasional skilful varying of its painful realism
<a name="png.093" id="png.093"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">89</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>with a colouring of romance, as in the relations
between Dawes and Sylvia: his absorbing
devotion when she is so strangely made
dependent upon him at the deserted settlement;
his long-continued confidence that she
will effect his vindication and deliverance;
and, finally, the dominant motive of securing
her safety against North with which he
escapes from the gaol at Norfolk Island, and
joins her in the doomed schooner on its last
voyage to Van Diemen&#8217;s Land.</p>

<p>What Oliver Wendell Holmes called &lsquo;the
Robinson Crusoe touches&rsquo; in the story&mdash;including
the experiences of the marooned
party at Macquarie Harbour, and those of
Rex in his escape through the Devil&#8217;s Blowhole&mdash;also
help to leave with the reader of
the novel an ineffaceable memory.</p>

 /></span>HENRY KINGSLEY.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">What</span> are the special qualities that constitute
the permanent charm of Henry Kingsley&#8217;s
early novels? Some English critics, judging
him by principles of literary art, have said
that his best work is in many places of
slovenly construction, deficient in dramatic
power, and imitative in expression. A series
of episodes, they observe, supply the place
of a plot in <cite>The Recollections of Geoffry
Hamlyn</cite>; the central motive of <cite>The Hillyars
and the Burtons</cite> is an impossible story
of a young woman&#8217;s self-sacrifice; and the
Thackerayan mannerisms in <cite>Ravenshoe</cite> are
an offensive blemish upon an otherwise fine
novel.</p>

<p>As a set-off to these defects, which are of
less real consequence than may appear from
<a name="png.095" id="png.095"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">91</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>their brief enumeration, Kingsley has been
freely credited with a certain ever-pleasing
vivacity and gallantry of style far too rare in
literature to be overlooked. The warmest
of his admirers in his own country have
even attempted to raise him to a position
above that of his more celebrated brother.</p>

<p>The task of comparing Kingsley the poet,
preacher, and reformer, with Kingsley the
laughing, genial teller of stories who never
cherished a hobby in his life, would seem to
be as superfluous on general grounds as it is
premature in respect of the only possible
question as to which of them is likely to be
best remembered a generation or two hence.
Only in one particular does it seem quite
safe to predict&mdash;namely, that whatever may
be the future standing of one who is said to
have never penned a story without a didactic
purpose of some kind, Henry Kingsley is
certain of a permanent place in the literature
of the young country where he encountered
both the best and the worst experiences of
his life.</p>

<p>The English estimate of his novels&mdash;mainly
<a name="png.096" id="png.096"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">92</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>a technical one&mdash;having been recorded, it
seems to the present writer that something
of interest might be said of them from, as
far as possible, the Australian point of view,
the standpoint of the reader who knows the
country of Sam Buckley and Alice Brentwood,
and has lived some of their life. Two
out of the three best novels are largely
Australian in matter, and the reasons for
their enduring popularity in the colonies are
among the best grounds of the favour in
which the author is held by the average
English reader, to leave out of reckoning
for the moment the literary expert. <cite>Geoffry
Hamlyn</cite> and <cite>The Hillyars and the Burtons</cite>
have obvious faults, but in most respects
they are the highest, because the least artificial,
expression of Kingsley&#8217;s powers. A
consideration of some of their more noticeable
qualities will perhaps afford the clearest
answer to the question which opens this
essay.</p>

<p>Henry Kingsley was one of the many
impecunious young Englishmen of education
and adventurous spirit who sought fortune
<a name="png.097" id="png.097"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">93</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>on the gold-fields of Australia between 1851
and 1860, and were rewarded in some cases
with ready wealth, but in far more with bitter
disappointment. Leaving Oxford without a
degree in the company of two fellow-students,
he hurried off to the Victorian gold-fields,
which were then in the early sensational
period of their development, and attracting
people from all parts of the world. It was
the time when the ordinary business of the
colonies could scarcely be carried on at any
sacrifice&mdash;when some of the more perplexed
employers in the adjoining territory of New
South Wales had urged Governor Fitzroy to
proclaim martial law and peremptorily prohibit
mining, &lsquo;in order that the inducement
which seemed so irresistible to persons to
quit their ordinary occupations might be removed.&rsquo;
In the country districts crops were
left unreaped and sheep unshorn; in the
towns masters did their own work or paid
excessively to have it half done; while the
harbours were filled with vessels whose crews
had deserted to join in the general scramble
for gold.  No one was content to stand
<a name="png.098" id="png.098"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">94</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>behind a counter all day and hear of nuggets
being found up-country which sold for over
four thousand pounds. &lsquo;As well attempt to
stop the influx of the tide as stop the rush to
the diggings,&rsquo; was the reply given by Fitzroy
to his petitioners.</p>

<p>Ex-military and naval officers, professional
men, convicts from Van Diemen&#8217;s Land,
picturesque cut-throats from the Californian
and Mexican mines, Chinese, and many
other varieties of the human species, rubbed
shoulders and lived generally in remarkable
order and amity in the crowded canvas cities
of Turon, Mount Alexander, Ballarat, and
Bendigo. In 1852, the year before Kingsley&#8217;s
arrival, seventy thousand of them were toiling
in Victoria alone.</p>

<p>Such were the times and the people which
gave the future novelist his first practical
experience of colonial life. The varied
knowledge that he accumulated, first of the
gold-fields and later of pastoral life and the
towns, was the only reward of his five years&#8217;
voluntary exile from England. During his
absence he never wrote to his parents, and
<a name="png.099" id="png.099"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">95</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>they thought him dead. His reticence as to
his unsuccessful struggles was continued
when he returned home, and not relaxed in
later life even to his wife.</p>

<p>An interesting memoir by Mr. Clement
Shorter, prefixed to a new edition of
Kingsley&#8217;s novels, briefly describes his
school-days and literary career, but is almost
wholly silent concerning the eventful years
spent in the colonies. There is a single
reference to the period which succeeded his
gold-digging days, when want forced him to
seek a less precarious occupation. For a
time, it seems, he was a mounted policeman
in New South Wales, until, &lsquo;compelled by
duty to attend an execution, he was so much
affected that he threw up the appointment
in disgust.&rsquo; Then, like many another unlucky
digger, he was obliged to travel the
country in search of work on the sheep and
cattle stations.</p>

<p>A well-known pastoralist of the western
district of Victoria, the late Hon. Philip
Russell, was accustomed to describe to his
friends the arrival at his station many years
<a name="png.100" id="png.100"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">96</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>ago of a party of &lsquo;sundowners&rsquo; (<i>i.e.</i>, tramps),
among whom was Kingsley, looking &lsquo;very
much down on his luck.&rsquo; Soon found to be
no ordinary swagman, he was made a guest
at the station, where he remained for several
months. The most agreeable glimpse obtainable
of his colonial life is given in <cite>Old
Melbourne Memories</cite>, a little collection of
sketches published by Rolf Boldrewood
twelve years ago.</p>

<p>At the period which they recall, Boldrewood
was a young man, and making the
experiment in squatting which, though disastrous
in its ultimate commercial results,
was afterwards turned to a rich literary
account by him. A friend of his named
Mitchell occupied a station in western
Victoria named Langa-willi, and there on
one occasion Boldrewood met Kingsley.
The passage in which he gracefully records
the event is worth quoting in full.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why Langa-willi,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;will always
be a point of interest in my memory, apart
from other reasons, for I spent many a
pleasant day there, was that Henry Kingsley
<a name="png.101" id="png.101"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">97</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>lived there the chief part of a year as a guest
of Mitchell&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It was at Langa-willi that <cite>Geoffry
Hamlyn</cite>, that immortal work, the best
Australian novel, and for long the only one,
was written. In the well-appointed sitting-room
of that most comfortable cottage one
can imagine the gifted but somewhat ill-fated
author sitting down comfortably after
breakfast to his &ldquo;copy,&rdquo; when his host had
ridden forth with his overseer to make-believe
to inspect the flocks, but in reality to get an
appetite for lunch.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I like to think of them both spending the
evening sociably in their own way, both
rather silent men&mdash;Kingsley writing away
till he had covered the regulation number of
sheets or finished the chapter, perhaps when
the bushrangers came to Garoopna; Mitchell
reading steadily, or writing up his home
correspondence; the old housekeeper coming
in with the glasses at ten o&#8217;clock; then a
tumbler of toddy, a smoke on the verandah,
or over the fire if in winter, and so to bed.
Peaceful, happy, unexciting days and nights,
<a name="png.102" id="png.102"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">98</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>good for Mitchell, who was not strong, and
for his talented guest, who was not always
so profitably employed. I suspect that in
England, where both abode in later years,
they often looked back with regret to the
peerless climate, the calm days, the restful
evenings spent so far beyond the southern
main at Langa-willi.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At least one of them must often have
recalled those days as being among the
happiest of a none too happy life. The
main features of Kingsley&#8217;s career after he
returned to England may be summarised
here in a few words. The distinct success
as a novelist which he won during the first
four or five years was not maintained. His
work lessened in interest as he lost the <i>verve</i>
of youth, increased his leaning towards
romance, and became more conventional in
his methods.</p>

<p>He essayed journalism for a time, first as
editor of the Edinburgh <cite>Daily Review</cite>, and
later as a correspondent of the same journal
at the Franco-German War. As an editor
he was a failure, through being without the
<a name="png.103" id="png.103"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">99</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>necessary technical training, and it does not
appear that he had much opportunity to
distinguish himself as a war correspondent.
The writing of fiction was his proper work,
and his success at it seemed always to be
in proportion to the amount of personal
experience which he employed to support
the superstructure of his somewhat reckless
fancy. Those of Kingsley&#8217;s friends
who contribute to the brief memoir of his
life bear unanimous testimony to the personal
brightness and kindness of which he
has left so worthy a memorial in his first
novels.</p>

<p>It is characteristic of Kingsley that he
never wrote an ungenerous word of the
country which sent him away empty-handed
from the store of its riches. Not even a
suggestion of the fruitless toil and the disillusionment
which he shared with scores of
other amateur diggers during the first two
years of his colonial life finds expression
in any of his novels. His choice of incident
and adventure in <cite>Geoffry Hamlyn</cite> seems to
imply a deliberate ignoring of what was
<a name="png.104" id="png.104"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">100</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>by far the most striking development of
Antipodean life in the decade of 1850-60.</p>

<p>The gold-fields were then in a sense an
epitome of the world, the centre at which
all men&#8217;s thoughts converged, an ever-changing
spectacle, a daily source of novelty
and suggestion. The life of the squatters
was primitive, inferior in variety, and marked
only by a rapid accumulation of wealth, which
was in itself but a part of the general prosperity
created by the discovery of gold. If
Kingsley wished to repress memories which
it would have been against his cheerful
nature to perpetuate, he succeeded with
singular completeness.</p>

<p>Save the technical knowledge of geology
shown by Trevittick in <cite>The Hillyars and
the Burtons</cite>, and by the encyclopædic Dr.
Mulhaus in his lecture at the picnic in the
grass-covered crater of Mirngish, there is
nothing to suggest that the author had any
personal acquaintance with mining in the
colonies. The experience that was so fresh
and abundant in his mind is put aside in
favour of a set of facts and pictures not even
<a name="png.105" id="png.105"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">101</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>incidentally connected with life on the gold-fields.</p>

<p>As if to emphasise the motive of his choice,
if motive there was, he selected the pre-auriferous
period for the Australian parts of
his stories. His squatters become wealthy by
a comparatively slow process, extending over
some sixteen years. The squatters of the
gold period would certainly seem better
adapted to the purposes of fiction. There
is, indeed, more than a suggestion of romance
in the sudden burst of fortune which within
the first few years after 1851 raised so many
of them from positions of struggling uncertainty
to affluence, with incomes varying from
ten to twenty thousand pounds, and in some
few cases as high as thirty thousand pounds,
a year.</p>

<p>The first and last use Kingsley made of his
gold-fields experience is seen in the sketch of
mining of the successful sort in the third
volume of <cite>The Hillyars and the Burtons</cite>,
but this is so slight that it might have been
imagined by a writer who had never handled
a shovel or a washing-cradle in his life.</p>

<p><a name="png.106" id="png.106"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">102</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>The Australian people have so often been
the subject of flippant and ill-natured criticisms,
that they can readily appreciate any
liberal estimate of themselves in whatever
form it may be placed before their kindred in
Great Britain. It is a fact, as natural as it is
undeniable, that they are very sensitive to
praise or blame. What wounds them more
than adverse comment itself, is the circumstance
of its often proceeding from persons
who have accepted without warning their too
prompt and trustful hospitality.</p>

<p>To anyone but the incorrigibly confident
and good-natured Antipodean, the lesson
would be obvious, namely, that the distinguished
visitor should be petted less, and
left more dependent upon his own devices
in the collection of materials for the inevitable
book or magazine article. Though the result
might be the same, there would be no ingratitude,
and the critic would be less able
to pose as an impartial inside observer of
Australian society.</p>

<p>Perhaps, indeed, though this implies a
somewhat wild flight of imagination, he
<a name="png.107" id="png.107"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">103</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>might altogether escape the fatal sense of
compulsion towards printers&#8217;-ink, under which
the traveller of a few weeks&#8217; or months&#8217; experience
commonly labours when once he has
extricated himself from the blandishments of
Toorak or Darling Point.</p>

<p>It is true that Australia has received many
a compliment from casual writers, but to
Australians themselves it is always a question
whether these kindnesses are not outbalanced
by the inaccuracies which surround them.
For it may as well be said at once that the
younger colonists do not relish being denied
all native individuality, and depicted with a
complaisant condescension as mere imitators
of English life. It is well to be a Briton,
they say, but better to be an Australian. And
who shall say that their self-satisfaction is not
healthy and pardonable?</p>

<p>By contrast with the judgments of persons
to whom candour concerning the colonies
seems to be a stern duty, Henry Kingsley&#8217;s
pictures of the pioneer life of Australia fifty
years ago, and his liberal estimate (since
largely realised) of the future of the country,
<a name="png.108" id="png.108"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">104</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>find more enduring appreciation than would,
perhaps, be accorded such writing in ordinary
circumstances.</p>

<p>The good feeling that shines on every
page of <cite>Geoffry Hamlyn</cite> would earn gratitude
from Australian readers were the story
not in itself spirited and absorbing. If
from the personal experiences with which
this first novel is crowded Kingsley excluded
everything that might be unfavourable to the
reputation of Australia and its people, he at
least told nothing that was untrue. His
record of the country is a generous one, but
there is no flattery&mdash;at least, none of the
grosser sort.</p>

<p>It is one of his supreme qualities, too, that
while delighting to preserve unmodified the
British spirit and traditions in his emigrant
colonists, he surrounds their offspring with
a subtle distinction. Some of the manly
strength and courtly serenity, the truth,
honour, and delicacy of the ideal Englishman
and Englishwoman they reproduce; and then
there is added a something caught from the
warm air and the broader expanses of the
<a name="png.109" id="png.109"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">105</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>South&mdash;a new impulse, a deeper tinge in the
blood, a greater trust in human nature.</p>

<p>As befitting the early period of which the
novelist wrote, this difference is not strongly
marked, and is more readily recognisable in
the light of colonial experience than without
it; but it clearly exists. Its continuation at
the present day is far more apparent. Kingsley&#8217;s
young Australians are home-taught, and
necessarily display most of the characteristics
of their British parents. But, still, they show
themselves types of a new race, which has
now its hundreds of representatives in the
homes of the Australian gentry.</p>

<p>Of such was the young squatter who so
attracted the attention of Mr. Froude at the
first station he visited in Victoria. &lsquo;He had
till within a month or two been herding cattle
in Queensland, doing the work for four years
of the roughest emigrant field hand, yet had
retained the manners of the finest of fine
gentlemen&mdash;tall, spare-loined, agile as a deer,
and with a face that might have belonged to
Sir Lancelot.&rsquo; Of course, the genial author
of <cite>Oceana</cite> made no pretence of minute
<a name="png.110" id="png.110"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">106</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>observation in the account of his travels.
Had he not been content to fly through the
country, viewing it mainly, as he admits,
from &lsquo;softest sofas&rsquo; of &lsquo;a superlative carriage
lined with blue satin,&rsquo; he might have seen
not one, but many fine specimens of what
Sir George Bowen has aptly called the working
aristocracy of Australia.</p>

<p>The little Arcadian kingdom&mdash;cheerful,
self-contained, and picturesque&mdash;of the Buckleys,
the Brentwoods, and their historian,
Geoffry Hamlyn, of the Mayfords, Tom
Troubridge, Mary Hawker, and the rest, far
from illustrates all the intermittent successes
and hardships which have commonly attended
squatting in Australia. The toil, loneliness,
and monotony of the occupation are scarcely
mentioned. The aspect represented is almost
entirely the agreeable one.</p>

<p>There is, it must be admitted, some ground
for the charge that he has made squatting
life &lsquo;too much like a prolonged picnic.&rsquo; Had
Kingsley been himself a pastoralist, a hundred
minute experiences might have obtained expression
which he has avoided.  In this
<a name="png.111" id="png.111"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">107</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>respect the historical value of his work is
less than it might have been. But the compensating
gain in human interest more than
justifies the author&#8217;s choice of treatment. He
never allowed himself to forget that he was
telling a story, that he was writing the adventures
of a small group of emigrant English
families, not a history of colonial settlement
and its difficulties. Nor does he ever take
advantage of the fact that, with the exception
of two or three others whose works are collections
of sketches rather than novels, and
whose names are now almost forgotten, he
was the first to describe in fiction the rural
life of the country, to recognise the beginning
of an aristocracy of landholders, and to commemorate
the pervading spirit of cheerful
confidence to which so much of the rapid
early development of Australia was due.</p>

<p>It may well be regretted that one who had
so keen an eye for all that was best in the
social life of the country, at one of its most
interesting periods, should not have written a
volume or two of reminiscences, but no
colonial reader would wish <cite>Geoffry Hamlyn</cite>
<a name="png.112" id="png.112"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">108</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>or <cite>The Hillyars and the Burtons</cite> to have
been made the vehicle of more descriptive
matter than they contain. Kingsley was
more sparing in the use of local colour and
incident than Boldrewood and some of the
younger writers are, though in his first novel
a few passages occur which may be considered
unnecessary, including the story told
by the hut-keeper to Hamlyn in the presence
of the disguised bushrangers, the whisking of
Captain Blockstrop and his friends on and off
the stage, and the story of the lost child. The
latter, however, like Dr. Mulhaus&#8217; geological
lecture, has the merit of being one of the best
pieces of prose the author ever wrote, and
gives Sam Buckley and Cecil Mayford an
opportunity for a dramatic settlement of the
order of their suit for the hand of Alice Brentwood.
In the main narrative the periods of
&lsquo;dull prosperity&rsquo; are expressly avoided. After
that first beautiful picture of the pioneer
settlement, &lsquo;the scene so venerable, so
ancient, so seldom seen in the old world&mdash;the
patriarchs moving into the desert with all
their wealth to find a new pasture land&rsquo;&mdash;the
<a name="png.113" id="png.113"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">109</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>action of the story is rapidly advanced to
the later days of their success. The estate
which has been the home of Major Buckley&#8217;s
forefathers for generations no longer providing
a competence, he has resolutely left it
for the land where he is to find &lsquo;a new heaven
and a new earth.&rsquo; Unlike so many of the
pioneers, he has bade a final good-bye to
England, but that it is <em>not</em> &lsquo;for ever&rsquo; one can
safely predict from the outset. He sees the
old country in long years after, when, with
some of the wealth garnered on the rolling
prairies of Northern Australia, his son has
proudly bought back the family domain of
Clere in all the completeness of its original
acres. Within a few brief chapters the
colonists are discovered in the security of
assured wealth. Sitting under their station
verandahs, they can contemplate almost with
calmness the death of their cattle by hundreds,
and the devastation of their runs by Bush
fires. They have arrived at the period when
&lsquo;there was money in the bank, claret in the
cellar, and race-horses in the paddock.&rsquo;
Meanwhile, the old Devonshire life is
<a name="png.114" id="png.114"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">110</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>becoming a dim memory. They have kept
their promise to create a new Drumston in
the wilderness, and are well content with
their homes among the southern fern-clad
hills. The history of their intercourse
approaches the character of an epic. Over
his structure of realism&mdash;of life as he saw it
and lived it himself&mdash;the writer has cast a
softening glow of romance, through which
are seen the beauties of ideal friendship, of
youthful love, family affection, pride of
nationality, and charity towards all mankind.</p>

<p>Kingsley was a lover of his fellows, and
wont to declare that the proportion of good
to bad in human nature was as ten to one
the world over. This tenet of his religion
he infused in some measure into all his
novels. It is this they teach if they teach
anything. From it spring their most vital
qualities. The best of the stories possess
that &lsquo;certain intellectual and spiritual atmosphere,&rsquo;
which Matthew Arnold assigned as
the gift of literary genius. Their virility
and right feeling are unmistakable, and
insensibly teach the practice of a silent and
<a name="png.115" id="png.115"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">111</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>kindly forbearance towards the foibles of
our fellow-creatures. The names alone of
the principal characters in <cite>Geoffry Hamlyn</cite>
recall scene after scene in their idyllic life to
which it refreshes the mind to return. There
is Major Buckley, a hero of Waterloo,
gigantic in stature, refined, calmly courageous&mdash;a
fitting leader of the settlement; Mrs.
Buckley, high-bred, stately, self-reliant, a
model English matron; Tom Troubridge,
the big, merry Devonian, grown with prosperity
weighty and didactic in his speech,
and thinking of turning his attention to
politics; Miss Thornton, the dignified, sweet
old maid, born to spend her life in uncomplaining
service of others; Mary Hawker,
tragic, passionate, paying the slow penalty of
youthful wilfulness; Captain Brentwood, of
Wellington&#8217;s artillery, and his gallant son
Jim, who is sighing for a red coat and a
commission; Sam and Alice, the young
lovers so nearly lost to each other &lsquo;in the
year when the bushrangers came down&rsquo;;
and Dr. Mulhaus, the mysterious German,
with his good-humoured roar, first heard at
<a name="png.116" id="png.116"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">112</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>old Drumston, and with us to the end, who
is everybody&#8217;s friend and counsellor, and
beloved by all&mdash;except George Hawker, of
whose &lsquo;tom-cat&rsquo; skull he has made that
amusingly audacious examination at the
beginning of their acquaintance. It is delightful
to find all the faces familiar in the old
land reappearing in the new, even though
the coincidences which attend their coming
seem too good to be true.</p>

<p>But the reader forgets the occasional loose-jointedness
of the story in contemplation of
the swift succession of happy scenes created
for him. In these there is nothing dubious
or artificial. They are sketches straight from
the life of the country, and it is their beauty
that makes <cite>Geoffry Hamlyn</cite> a classic in Australian
literature.</p>

<p>Among the characters, there are so many
who inspire us with love rather than mere
interest, that a multiplicity of similar scenes,
of conversations, rides, pleasure-excursions,
and other intercourse, which in another book
might prove wearisome, becomes here the
best enjoyment of the reader. With what
<a name="png.117" id="png.117"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">113</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>vivacity and gusto the author describes the
visits exchanged between the home stations,
and the comforts and happiness which they
reveal! Half the book is made up of them,
and yet the majority remain sufficiently clear
in the memory to be recalled separately.
Brentwood, who is at first fifty miles away,
buys a station near at hand, he and Buckley
having become inseparable, and now Baroona,
Garoopna, and Toonarbin are only a few miles
apart. &lsquo;There was always a hostage from
one staying as a guest at the other.&rsquo; The
visits were generally unannounced, and the
visitors stayed as long as they felt inclined
to. The effects of this custom are once
amusingly illustrated at the home of Captain
Brentwood. It is when the members of the
little colony hear of the arrival of his beautiful
daughter from Sydney, where she has
been at school. &lsquo;That week one of those
runs upon the Captain&#8217;s hospitality took place
which are common enough in the Bush, and,
although causing a temporary inconvenience,
are generally as much enjoyed by the entertainers
as the entertained. Everybody during
<a name="png.118" id="png.118"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">114</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>this next week came to see them, and nobody
went back again. So by the end of the
week there were a dozen or fourteen guests
assembled, all uninvited, and apparently bent
on making a long stay of it.&rsquo; They help
one another when there is work to be
done, dine sumptuously, picnic luxuriously.
Kingsley has properly made eating and
drinking a noticeable part of the hearty
full-bodied existence of his squatters and
their friends.</p>

<p>There is no class of people who have a
better capacity for enjoying the material comforts
of life than the country gentlemen of
Australia. Major Buckley is just the sort of
person one might have expected to hold
decided views on the subject of dining as
an art. To dine in the middle of the day
was, in his opinion, a gross abuse of the
gifts of Providence. &lsquo;I eat my dinner not
so much for the sake of the dinner itself
as for the after-dinnerish feeling which
follows&mdash;a feeling that you have nothing
to do, and that, if you had, you&#8217;d be shot
if you&#8217;d do it.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.119" id="png.119"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">115</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>On another occasion the author himself
preaches a similarly agreeable doctrine, concluding
with the advice: &lsquo;My brother, let us
breakfast in Scotland, lunch in Australia, and
dine in France, till our lives end.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Nor is the kindred subject of lounging in
midsummer forgotten. Anyone in an armchair
under a broad Australian verandah,
who fetched anything for himself, would, in
the author&#8217;s opinion, &lsquo;show himself a man
of weak mind.&rsquo; Niggers were all that a
Southern gentleman wanted to complete his
comfort when the sun was at baking-point.
Mrs. Beecher Stowe&#8217;s teachings undergo a
playful deprecation. Did she know the
exertion required for cutting up a pipe of
tobacco in a hot north wind; or the amount
of perspiration and anger superinduced by
knocking the head off a bottle of Bass in
January; or the physical prostration caused
by breaking two lumps of hard white sugar
in a pawnee before a thunderstorm? The
Southern gentleman undertakes to affirm that
she didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>In the conversation of Kingsley&#8217;s colonists,
<a name="png.120" id="png.120"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">116</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the business of the squatter, his hopes, fears
and struggles, find no place, and the idea of
hard work is never obtruded for its own sake.
The talk is the talk of a cultured class who
live wholesome lives and have no cares. The
twelve thousand miles that separate them
from the centre of their intellectual life are
obliterated. The men preserve their individual
tastes, together with that comradeship
and mutual considerateness which have their
origin in the best traditions of college life.
The same loyalty and chivalry are prominently
reproduced in the characters of <cite>Ravenshoe</cite>
and <cite>Silcote of Silcotes</cite>. But in <cite>Geoffry
Hamlyn</cite> these qualities are perhaps more
noticeable (at all events to a colonial reader)
than in the later novels, because of the
contrast they furnish to the essentially competitive
life of modern Australia. Brentwood
is &lsquo;excessively attached to mathematics, and
has leisure to gratify his hobby&rsquo;; Harding,
&lsquo;an Oxford man,&rsquo; is &lsquo;an inveterate writer of
songs,&rsquo; a pastime which only the annual
business of shearing is permitted to interrupt;
Buckley is intent on the education of his son,
<a name="png.121" id="png.121"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">117</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>in which he is careful to provide for a knowledge
of the Latin Grammar; while Doctor
Mulhaus finds the new country an even
better field than the old one for his researches
as a naturalist and geologist. In telling his
story, Kingsley seems, in short, to have
treated pioneer squatting in Australia as the
brighter aspects of English country life have
been treated in fiction for generations past.
He expends his best efforts in showing the
picturesque surroundings and interior comfort
of Australian homes. Neither their tables
nor their bookshelves lack any of the best
luxuries of the hour. The greyness and
rawness of their environment are not touched
upon. Marcus Clarke could never have
shown the Australian people so much of the
beauty of their strange fauna and flora as
can be found in <cite>Geoffry Hamlyn</cite>. He would
have allowed the budding civilisation of the
country to be swallowed up in sombre
desolate forests, or appear as lonely specks
on bleached and thirsty plains. Though he
might intend the contrary, that, substantially,
would be the final impression left on the
<a name="png.122" id="png.122"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">118</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>mind of the reader. Australian scenery
awed and depressed him. With all his
powers of graphic expression, he could
seldom write of it without exaggeration. It
was the fascination of the grotesque rather
than the picturesque that he felt. Kingsley,
though scarcely so graceful and vivid a
describer, had a keener and more constant
sense of natural beauty. His vision was
unclouded by the peculiar susceptibility of
temperament which narrowed the view of
his brilliant contemporary. He could not
have indulged in rhetorical flourishes at
the expense of accuracy, as in the familiar
passage professing to give the Australian
view of &lsquo;our trees without shade, our flowers
without perfume, our birds who cannot fly,
our beasts who have not yet learned to walk
on all fours.&rsquo; A comparison of Marcus
Clarke&#8217;s too often quoted description with
the sketches of landscape given in, say,
the twentieth, twenty-eighth and thirty-sixth
chapters of <cite>Geoffry Hamlyn</cite> and at the beginning
of the third volume of <cite>The Hillyars
and the Burtons</cite> curiously illustrates how
<a name="png.123" id="png.123"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">119</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>far the appreciation of Australian scenery
depends upon the point of view of the
observer.</p>

<p>Kingsley&#8217;s descriptions, like all else that
he wrote of the country, breathe an unmistakable
personal enjoyment. They are the
natural expression of a happy disposition,
just as is the boyish fun with which he
surrounds the love-making of his characters.
&lsquo;Halbert kicked Jim&#8217;s shins under the table,
and whispered: &ldquo;You&#8217;ve lost your money,
old fellow!&rdquo;&rsquo; when Sam Buckley, flushed
and happy, rejoined his friends in the sitting-room
at Garoopna, after proposing to Alice in
the garden. Jim Brentwood had peevishly
bet his friend that the lovers would go on
shilly-shallying half their lives; but Halbert,
with keener vision, had foreseen the very
hour of their betrothal, and made a bet of
five pounds on the event. More comical
still is the spectacle of Hamlyn ducking
under the bedclothes to escape the boot that
is about to be flung at him, for laughingly
discrediting the story of which his bosom-friend
Stockbridge has tragically unburdened
<a name="png.124" id="png.124"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">120</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>himself concerning the evaporation of his
love for Mary Hawker.</p>

<p>Whether in recording the actions and
dialogue of his characters, or in describing
scenery and the habits of the birds and
animals which figure so often in his first
novel, Kingsley always reflected some of his
own happiness. It is not wit nor subtle
humour, but a combination of pure mirth
with the enthusiasm of warm friendship, that
maintains one&#8217;s interest in the simple life of
the new Drumston. There is an abundance
of farcical fun and playfulness which force
laughter, and never approach an unkindness.
The men avoid being smart at each other&#8217;s
expense; and if they cannot claim to be
clever or heroic, they are at least good
fellows, any one of whom might serve as a
model of manliness.</p>

<p>Kingsley&#8217;s knowledge of household pets
was of the kind exhibited by persons who
have spent some period of their lives in
loneliness, with only the companionship of
dumb creatures. He was an acute observer
of their peculiarities, with the noting of
<a name="png.125" id="png.125"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">121</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>which he combined a whimsical exaggeration.
The account of the menagerie which
Sam Buckley found at Garoopna on the
occasion of his memorable first meeting with
Alice Brentwood is almost unique in Australian
literature.</p>

<p>Buckley&#8217;s ride to rescue his sweetheart
from the bushrangers is one of the most
moving and dramatic incidents in the book,
and a good specimen of Kingsley&#8217;s graphic
narrative style. A band of the outlaws who
were the terror of pioneer colonists fifty
years ago have risen in the district, and, after
committing outrages at one station, are reported
to be riding on to another twenty
miles distant. At the latter, Captain Brentwood&#8217;s
home, Alice happens to be alone.
When the terrible news comes to her young
lover, he is at Baroona, which by the shortest
road is ten miles from Brentwood&#8217;s. What
start have the bushrangers had, and will they
arrive before him?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sam&#8217;s noble horse, Widderin, a horse with a pedigree
a hundred years old, stood in the stable. The buying
of that horse had been Sam&#8217;s only extravagance, for
<a name="png.126" id="png.126"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">122</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>which he had often reproached himself, and now this
day he would see whether he would get his money&#8217;s-worth
out of that horse or no.</p>

<p>I followed him up to the stable, and found him putting
the bridle on Widderin&#8217;s beautiful little head. Neither
of us spoke; only when I handed him the saddle, and
helped him with the girths, he said, &lsquo;God bless you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>I ran out and got down the slip-rails for him. As he
rode by, he said, &lsquo;Good-bye, Uncle Jeff; perhaps you
won&#8217;t see me again&rsquo;; and I cried out, &lsquo;Remember your
God and your mother, Sam, and don&#8217;t do anything
foolish.&rsquo; Then he was gone&hellip;.</p>

<p>Looking across the plains the way he should go, I
saw another horseman toiling far away, and recognised
Doctor Mulhaus. Good Doctor! he had seen the danger
in a moment, and by his ready wit had got a start of
everyone else by ten minutes. The Doctor, on his
handsome, long-bodied Arabian mare, was making good
work of it across the plains, when he heard the rush
of a horse&#8217;s feet behind him, and turning, he saw tall
Widderin bestridden by Sam, springing over the turf,
gaining on him stride after stride. In a few minutes
they were alongside of one another.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good lad!&rsquo; cried the Doctor. &lsquo;On, forwards; catch
her, and away to the woods with her! Bloodhound
Desborough will be on their trail in half an hour. Save
her, and we will have noble vengeance!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Sam only waved his hand in good-bye, and sped on
across the plain like a solitary ship at sea. The good
horse, with elastic and easy motion, fled on his course
like a bird, lifting his feet clearly and rapidly through
the grass. The brisk south wind filled his wide nostrils
<a name="png.127" id="png.127"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">123</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>as he turned his graceful neck from side to side, till,
finding that work was meant, and not play, he began to
hold his head straight before him, and rush steadily
forward&hellip;.</p>

<p>One stumble now, and it were better to lie down on
the plain and die. He was in the hands of God, and
he felt it. He said one short prayer, but that towards
the end was interrupted by the wild current of his
thoughts. Was there any hope? They, the devils,
would have been drinking at the Mayfords&#8217;, and perhaps
would go slow; or would they ride fast and wild? After
thinking a short time, he feared the latter. They had
tasted blood, and knew that the country would be roused
on them shortly&hellip;.</p>

<p>Here are a brace of good pistols, and they with care
shall give account, if need be, of two men. After that,
nothing. It were better&mdash;so much better&mdash;not to live if
one were only ten minutes too late&hellip;. Now he was
in the forest again, and now as he rode quickly down
the steep sandy road among the bracken, he heard the
hoarse rush of the river in his ears, and knew the end
was well-nigh come&hellip;. Now the house was in sight,
and now he cried aloud some wild inarticulate sound of
thankfulness and joy. All was as peaceful as ever, and
Alice, unconscious, stood white-robed in the verandah,
feeding her birds.</p>

<p>As he rode up he shouted to her and beckoned. She
came running through the house, and met him breathless
at the doorway.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The bushrangers, Alice, my love!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;We
must fly this instant; they are close to us now.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She had been prepared for this. She knew her duty
<a name="png.128" id="png.128"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">124</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>well, for her father had often told her what to do. No
tears! no hysterics! She took Sam&#8217;s hand without a
word, and, placing her fairy foot upon his boot, vaulted
up into the saddle before him&hellip;. They crossed the
river, and dismounting, they led the tired horse up the
steep slope of turf that surrounded a little castellated tor
of bluestone&hellip;.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I do not see them anywhere, Alice,&rsquo; said Sam
presently. &lsquo;I see no one coming across the plains.
They must be either very near us in the hollow of the
river-valley, or else a long way off.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;There they are!&rsquo; said Alice. &lsquo;Surely there is a large
party of horsemen on the plain, but they are seven or
eight miles off.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ay, ten,&rsquo; said Sam. &lsquo;I am not sure that they are
horsemen.&rsquo; Then he said suddenly in a whisper, &lsquo;Lie
down, my love, in God&#8217;s name! Here they are, close
to us!&rsquo;</p>

<p>There burst on his ear a confused round of talking
and laughing, and out of one of the rocky gullies leading
towards the river came the men they had been flying
from, in number about fourteen. They had crossed the
river, for some unknown reason, and to the fear-struck
hiders it seemed as though they were making straight
towards their lair.</p>

<p>He had got Widderin&#8217;s head in his breast, blindfolding
him with his coat, for should he neigh now they were
undone indeed! As the bushrangers approached, the
horse began to get uneasy and paw the ground, putting
Sam in such an agony of terror that the sweat rolled
down his face. In the midst of this he felt a hand on
his arm, and Alice&#8217;s voice, which he scarcely recognised,
<a name="png.129" id="png.129"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">125</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>said in a fierce whisper: &lsquo;Give me one of your pistols,
sir!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Leave that to me!&rsquo; he replied, in the same tone.</p>

<p>&lsquo;As you please,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;but I must not fall alive
into their hands. Never look your mother in the face
again if I do.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He gave one more glance around, and saw that the
enemy would come within a hundred yards of their
hiding-place. Then he held the horse faster than ever
and shut his eyes.</p>

<p>Was it a minute only, or an hour, until they heard
the sound of the voices dying away in the roar of the
river, and, opening their eyes once more, looked into
one another&#8217;s faces? Faces they thought that they had
never seen before&mdash;so each told the other afterwards&mdash;so
wild, so haggard, and so strange.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If, as Professor Masson says, &lsquo;it is by his
characters that a novelist is chiefly judged,&rsquo;
Henry Kingsley&#8217;s future reputation will be
found to depend almost solely on what
he accomplished in <cite>Geoffry Hamlyn</cite>, <cite>The
Hillyars and the Burtons</cite> and <cite>Ravenshoe</cite>.
In the first two of these there is an abundance
of original observation and little conscious
study of character. The vivid
Australian scenes of the one, and the Chelsea
life of the other, are transcripts of the
author&#8217;s own memories.  His knowledge of
<a name="png.130" id="png.130"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">126</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the squatters he got by working for them and
living with them; what he knew of police and
convicts and bushrangers he learned in doing
police duty; the life of the Burtons, as told
in &lsquo;Jim Burton&#8217;s Story,&rsquo; was that which the
author saw during his boyhood round his
father&#8217;s old rectory on Chelsea Embankment.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He seemed to me,&rsquo; says Mrs.<!-- TN: period invisible in scan --> Thackeray
Ritchie, &lsquo;to have lived his own books, battled
them out and forced them into their living
shapes, to have felt them and been them all.&rsquo;
Hardly all&mdash;one feels bound to say. The
remark is entirely true of nearly everything
in <cite>Geoffry Hamlyn</cite> and of three-fourths of
<cite>The Hillyars and the Burtons</cite>, but to <cite>Ravenshoe</cite>
it applies in a more limited degree, and
to some of the later novels scarcely ever.
Either through carelessness (of which one
often suspects him) or deficiency of judgment,
Kingsley more than once allowed the
exigencies of his plots to destroy all consistency
in his characters.</p>

<p>Thus, Squire Silcote, the clever old ex-lawyer,
is made to retire from the world and
brood for many years, and on quite
<a name="png.131" id="png.131"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">127</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>insufficient grounds, in the belief that his first
wife had been unfaithful, and had tried
to poison him. Nothing short of a condition
of semi-insanity could explain his
conduct. In other respects the character
is finely conceived. Emma Burton, too, is a
perfectly natural and charming person until
she is employed to revive the old problem of
how far a sense of duty can triumph over the
power of love. Her devotion to her deformed
brother is wrong, because it is unnecessary.
But even if this were not the
case, it would be irrational in a woman so
eminently sensible and unromantic as she
is shown to be in the first half of the story.
Almost at the beginning of her voluntary
service she is represented as realising &lsquo;the
hideous fate to which she has condemned
herself in her fanaticism.&rsquo; It is quite impossible
to make the reader believe that,
loving Erne Hillyar as she did, she could for
years persist in rejecting him, and that her
brother would permit so much sacrifice on
his account.</p>

<p>The beautiful, crazy Gerty Neville is
<a name="png.132" id="png.132"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">128</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>another instance of perversion. Her silliness
is exaggerated in order that she shall
weary and disgust the <i>blasé</i> aristocrat who
has married her. Some of her chatter is
more inconceivable than the &lsquo;coo-ee-ing&rsquo;
which Mr. Hornung&#8217;s &lsquo;Bride from the Bush&rsquo;
employed to attract the attention of a colonial
acquaintance of hers in Rotten Row.</p>

<p>But the distortion which the character of
Emma Burton undergoes, and the caricature
of Gerty Neville, are, after all, easily pardonable
faults in a story rich in noble thought
and sympathy, bright with pretty, audacious
nonsense, and containing such real personages
as Jim Burton and his father and mother, Erne
Hillyar, and the Honourable Jack Dawson.</p>

<p>Even in <cite>Silcote of Silcotes</cite> there are
intermittent glimpses of finely-conceived
character which almost outbalance the eccentricities
of the Dark Squire and his sister,
the fantastic meddler in foreign intrigue.
Kingsley&#8217;s skill lay chiefly in his portrayal
of men, especially of young men, such as the
dashing Charles Ravenshoe and his philosophic
friend Marston (a study of the George
<a name="png.133" id="png.133"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">129</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Warrington type); Lord Welter, Lieutenant
Hillyar, and Colonel Tom Silcote, reckless
profligates, but likeable fellows all; Frank
Maberly, the athletic curate; and Sam
Buckley, the type of an Australian country
gentleman. With old men he was less successful.
Lord Saltire, the placid good-natured
cynic of <cite>Ravenshoe</cite>, is, however,
a clever exception. &lsquo;All old women are
beautiful,&rsquo; says Kingsley in one of his stories,
and he never portrayed one that was not.
His best are Miss Thornton and Lady Ascot.
The younger women, excepting Mary Hawker
and Adelaide Summers, are rather slightly
drawn. Even Alice Brentwood is a somewhat
indistinct personage compared with the
Australian girls of Mrs. Campbell Praed and
Ada Cambridge.</p>

<p>The superior position usually accorded
to <cite>Ravenshoe</cite> among Kingsley&#8217;s novels is
merited more by the soundness of its plot
than by the naturalness of its characters. It
was the author&#8217;s first essay in pure romance,
and, with Henry Kingsley, to build character
from imagination was always largely,
<a name="png.134" id="png.134"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">130</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>sometimes extravagantly, to idealise.  He loved
to people old country houses with walking
mysteries, to unravel tangled genealogies,
and discover secrets of youthful folly, to
apportion property to rightful heirs, and
endow his characters with a superhuman
generosity.  When Charles Ravenshoe is
recovering from the long illness which terminates
the full series of his misfortunes, he
sends for Welter, the man who might be
considered his arch-enemy, who not so long
before that had seduced Charles&#8217;s sister and
stole his <i>fiancée</i>. Ravenshoe is represented
as forgetting all his newly-suffered wrongs,
and thinking only of Welter as his favourite
schoolfellow and youthful companion. Anticipating
doubts as to the feasibility of this,
the author proceeds to discuss the point with
the reader, as he does in many similar instances
throughout the story.  He appears
to have a constant anxiety about the impression
he is making, and his comments and
confidences certainly become distasteful. But
this foible goes only a small way to discount
the sterling merits of the novel.</p>

 /></span>ADA CAMBRIDGE.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Towards</span> the close of 1890 the Australian
booksellers&mdash;a cautious, conservative class in
their attitude towards new fiction, especially
that produced by the adventurous female
writer of these latter days&mdash;began to display
so marked an interest in the work of Ada
Cambridge, that one not acquainted with
the circumstances of the case might have
credited them with a friendly&mdash;possibly a
patriotic&mdash;desire to give due place to a
newly-risen native genius. And when, in
the following year, another story from the
same pen appeared, the popularity of the
author was firmly established.</p>

<p>The neat red volumes were on every
stall; the Mudie of Melbourne gave them
a place of honour in his show-window, and
<a name="png.136" id="png.136"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">132</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the leading critical review said that the
second story possessed a charm which ought
to induce even the person who ignored
fiction on principle to make an exception in
its favour. It was the kind of gratifying
recognition that the public always believes
itself eager to offer the deserving young
writer. Yet Ada Cambridge&#8217;s literary work
had extended over no less a period than
fifteen years. Of course, much of this delay
in securing recognition might have been
avoided. Probably in England she could
have won a substantial reputation in a third
of the time, and with half the labour expended
by her in contributing to the Australian
press. But, as the wife of a country
clergyman, she had other matters besides
literature to occupy her attention, and was
content to write when there happened to be
leisure for it, and to see her work in a few of
the leading colonial newspapers.</p>

<p>About half a dozen novels were issued
in this way, besides occasional articles and
poems. The publication of the longer stories
in the <cite>Australasian</cite>, a high-class weekly
<a name="png.137" id="png.137"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">133</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>journal, ought in itself to have made a name
for the author, and possibly would have done
so, were they not in most cases so obviously
a local product, and therefore not to be
seriously considered. It was a repetition of
the experience of Rolf Boldrewood. In the
end, as usual, it was the English public that
first accepted her novels for what they were
worth.</p>

<p>Ada Cambridge is a native of Norfolk, the
lonely fens and quaint villages of which are
a picturesque background of some of her best
stories. In 1870, shortly after her marriage,
she went with her husband, the Rev. George
Frederick Cross, a clergyman of the Church
of England, to Wangaratta, in Victoria.
After residing successively in several other
country towns of this colony, they settled in
1893 at Williamstown, a waterside suburb of
Melbourne.</p>

<p>A novel entitled <cite>Up the Murray</cite>, dealing
with life in the colonies, was published by
Ada Cambridge (the author continues to issue
her work under her maiden name) in the
Melbourne press in 1875. Others of the
<a name="png.138" id="png.138"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">134</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>same character followed at irregular intervals.
Two were issued in book-form by a London
firm of publishers, but did not attain to much
more than a library circulation.</p>

<p>When the author again came before the
English public, it was with a novel in which
the purely Australian interest was rigidly
subordinated to dramatic quality and a richly
sympathetic study of character. <cite>A Marked
Man</cite> is the story of a younger son of an old
English county family who, while sharing
the pride and indomitable spirit of his
ancestry, develops a hatred for conventional
prejudices and religious cant, and, after
making a final assertion of independence by
marrying a farmer&#8217;s daughter, emigrates to
New South Wales to establish a name and
fortune on his own account.</p>

<p>The first half of the action takes place in
England, the remainder in the colonies. The
natural beauties surrounding the home of the
Delavels at Sydney are not less delicately
and poetically described than the village life
they have left behind in the mother country&mdash;the
patriarchal rule of an old-fashioned,
<a name="png.139" id="png.139"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">135</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>rather pompous house, over a people retaining
the hereditary respect of vassals for
their feudal lord; but the view given of
Australian society is, in keeping with the
relation to it of Richard Delavel and his
household, of the slightest kind.</p>

<p>Delavel and the only daughter whom he
has trained to be his second self, whose
comradeship makes him almost forget the
long-drawn thraldom of his early <i>mésalliance</i>,
live in a world so much and so necessarily
their own, that one is grateful for the good
taste which excluded from it the bustle and
commoner interests of colonial life. The
novel met with general, and in several instances
cordial, favour in England, and since
then the author has yearly increased her
reputation.</p>

<p>Three out of five of the later novels are,
like <cite>A Marked Man</cite>, made comparatively
independent of the distinctively local interest
to which we have been accustomed in the
works of most Australian authors. It is not
possible, for example, to point out anything
in the shape of an essentially local first cause
<a name="png.140" id="png.140"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">136</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>for any of the principal incidents of <cite>Not All
in Vain</cite> and <cite>A Marriage Ceremony</cite>. The
passionate half-brute, Neil Hammond, who
pursues the heroine of the former story
across the world, and terrorises her with his
unwelcome attentions, would have met a
violent death, or himself have murdered
someone, in his own country or elsewhere
as inevitably as in Australia; and the man
who killed him would not have found
Katherine Knowles less faithful during the
long years of his imprisonment had her sacrifice
been under the daily observation of
Hammond&#8217;s family and her own strait-laced
aunts in their East Norfolk home.</p>

<p>In <cite>A Marriage Ceremony</cite>, the only advantage
secured by taking the story from
London to Melbourne&mdash;instead of to New
York, let us say&mdash;seems to lie in whatever
added strength the sense of greater distance
imparts to the temporary appearance of a
final separation between Betty Ochiltree and
her strangely-wedded husband. The marriage
that was a condition of their inheritance
having been performed, bride and
<a name="png.141" id="png.141"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">137</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>bridegroom part in accordance with a previous
agreement. The former reappears as
a prominent figure in the society of modern
Melbourne&mdash;the Melbourne of 1893, when
the failure of banks and land companies was
a regular subject of morning news.</p>

<p>Here, it might be supposed, was an opportunity
for one or two vivid and instructive
sketches of the sensational period that witnessed
the proof of so much folly and its
punishment, and wrought so many more
effects on all classes of Australian society
than could be noted in the common records
of the time. But the great crisis is almost
ignored in the novel. There are merely a
few passing references to its progress, and a
mention of the loss on the part of Mrs.
Ochiltree of some of the wealth which she is
beginning to regard as having been rather
spuriously acquired.</p>

<p>Even the very successful story of the
<cite>Three Miss Kings</cite> and <cite>A Mere Chance</cite> tell
little of the city life of Australia, though
their action is placed in it almost exclusively.
The latter is a tale of match-making intrigue
<a name="png.142" id="png.142"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">138</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>and money-worship in Toorak, but the main
interest of the plot apart, the account of
fashionable Melbourne is a singularly colourless
one. As for Mrs. Duff-Scott and her
Major, the amiable pair who in the character
of leaders of Melbourne society undertake to
find husbands for Elizabeth King and her
sisters, and whose benevolent intentions are
so effectually forestalled, they are as conventionally
English as though they belonged
to the pages of Miss Braddon or Mrs. Henry
Wood.</p>

<p>Again, though during half of <cite>Fidelis</cite> we
are given occasional impressive and delightful
glimpses of Nature under southern skies, the
principal characters are English, and in
England is centred first and last the dominant
pathos of the story. A complete absence
of dialect from the novels helps to emphasise
the author&#8217;s slender use of extraneous aids to
interest.</p>

<p>The influence of Ada Cambridge&#8217;s twenty-five
years&#8217; Australian experience is shown in
her general outlook upon life, rather than in the
details of her work. The prevailing tone of
<a name="png.143" id="png.143"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">139</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>her books is one of marked cheerfulness,
sincerity, and simplicity; she has a hearty
dislike for conventional stupidities, especially
for the mock-modesty that stifles honest
sentiment; and she gives emphatic endorsement
to the pleasant dictum (which seems so
much more feasible in sunny Australia than
in colder northern lands) that the second half
of life is not less fruitful and satisfying than
the first.</p>

<p>As the general effect of Ada Cambridge&#8217;s
teaching, so far as it can be gathered from
her plots, and the few instances in which she
has permitted herself anything in the shape
of didactic expression, is to make us more
patient with life&#8217;s complexities and perceptive
of its compensations, and more content with
whatever happiness may be drawn in our
way by the chain of accidents called Destiny,
so do her principal characters, in their foibles
and their strength&mdash;in the little acts and
impulses which qualify alike their heroism
and their baseness&mdash;tend to make us more
discriminative and charitable.</p>

<p>In almost every case they are strong
<a name="png.144" id="png.144"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">140</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>studies from some point of view. Of deliberate
analysis there is very little; but
there are numerous realistic touches not
commonly admitted in fiction, which, handled
with skill and insight, keep the character
within the pale of common experience and
increase rather than alienate the reader&#8217;s
sympathy. Thus, Richard Delavel&#8217;s outburst
of relief upon the death of his first
wife, so far from being vulgar and brutal,
as it might have seemed in other circumstances,
recalls and emphasises the high sense
of duty and honour and the iron self-restraint
which had enabled him to be in all essentials
a good husband for twenty-five years to a
cold-hearted creature, between whom and
himself there had never been either common
interest or feeling, and for whose sake he
had relinquished the woman that would have
been his real mate in intellect and sympathy.
Delavel&#8217;s housekeeper, who is also a privileged
friend, takes him to task for his unseemly
hurry to go in search of this old love
before his wife had been a week in her grave.
He makes no secret of his relief.  &lsquo;The
<a name="png.145" id="png.145"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">141</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>sense that I am free is turning my brain with
joy,&rsquo; he confesses.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;I say it because I feel it. I am aware that it is in
very bad taste, but that doesn&#8217;t make it the less true.
Do you suppose people are never glad when their relations
die? They are&mdash;very often; they can&#8217;t help it;
only they pretend they are not, because it seems so
shocking. I don&#8217;t pretend&mdash;at least, I need not pretend
to you. The fault is not always&mdash;not all&mdash;on the side
of the survivors, Hannah. I don&#8217;t think I am any worse
than those who pretend a grief that they don&#8217;t feel. I
was never unkind to her&mdash;never in my life, that I can
remember. I did not kill her; I would have kept her
alive as long as I possibly could. I think&mdash;I hope&mdash;that
if I could have saved her by the sacrifice of my own
life, I should have done it without a single moment&#8217;s
hesitation.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am sure you would,&rsquo; said Hannah.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; he continued, with that unwonted fire blazing
in his eyes, &lsquo;since dead she is, I <em>am</em> glad&mdash;I am, I am!
I am glad as a man who has been kept in prison is to be
let out. It is not my fault; I would be sorry if I could.
Some day, Hannah&mdash;some day, when we have been dust
for a few hundred years&mdash;perhaps for a few score only&mdash;people
will wake up to see how stupid it is to drive a
man to be glad when his wife is dead. They are finding
out so many things; they will find that out too in time.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Probably it will still appear to many that
Delavel&#8217;s admission was at least indelicate
<a name="png.146" id="png.146"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">142</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>and inconsistent with his chivalrous nature.
It is not here possible to convey an adequate
impression of his fiery spirit, his long heart-hunger,
and the magnitude of the loss which
a wholly uncongenial marriage must ever
mean to such a man. When the full story of
his life and that of his quietly &lsquo;implacable&rsquo;
wife is read, his conduct seems natural and
excusable. It is as much a part of himself
as the tremulous tenderness with which he
ministers to the comfort of the frail Constance
Bethune, after finding and bringing her home,
or as his fierce grief when she dies.</p>

<p>Another very human spectacle that illustrates
the author&#8217;s method is the reunion of
Betty and Rutherford Ochiltree&mdash;the frank
selfishness of their mutual joy while the poor
woman who had been an unconscious barrier
between them lies dead under their roof. It
is a somewhat painful episode, and precludes
anything like high esteem for Rutherford, but
it has the quality of intense actuality.</p>

<p>In like manner is Adam Drewe shorn of
some of the merit of his devotion to the
heroine of <cite>Fidelis</cite> by being shown in
<a name="png.147" id="png.147"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">143</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>successive attachments to other women during
his long exile in Australia. The author recognises
that, &lsquo;the laws of literary romance
being so much at variance with the laws of
Nature,&rsquo; Adam is certain to suffer in the
reader&#8217;s good opinion for having &lsquo;continued
to hunger for feminine sympathy as well as
his daily dinner.&rsquo; No doubt his stature as a
hero lessens when it appears that though the
absent Fidelia was ever in his thoughts, and
a daily source of inspiration to him as a
writer, he twice narrowly escaped marriage&mdash;first
with a servant girl at his lodgings, and
afterwards with the daughter of his landlady&mdash;and
that at another period of his colonial
life he became involved in a disreputable
kind of Bohemianism. But he is not disgraced
by these lapses to the extent that the
author anticipates; at all events, they make
him more human than he could otherwise
have been.</p>

<p>It is this power of infusing a robust
humanity into her characters that makes the
distinctive feature of Ada Cambridge&#8217;s best
novels. In each, whatever the quality of the
<a name="png.148" id="png.148"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">144</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>plot, there are always two or three personages
who talk and act as real men and women
do&mdash;now rationally or in obedience to custom,
now passionately or with that perversity
which, as the author once describes it, &lsquo;is
like a natural law, independent of other laws,
the only one that persistently defies our calculations.&rsquo;
They are mostly big people with
big appetites. The beauty of the women is
the beauty of mind and of sound physical
health.</p>

<p>Susy Delavel was tall, well grown, straight
and graceful, with an intelligent, eager face,
though &lsquo;her mouth was large, her nose not
all it should have been, and her complexion
showed the want of parasols and veils.&rsquo; She
was &lsquo;not handsome at all, but decidedly
attractive.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Sarah French, the girl in <cite>Fidelis</cite> whose
comeliness so nearly drew the hero from his
old allegiance, has &lsquo;a strong and good, rather
than a pretty, face,&rsquo; with a &lsquo;large and substantial
figure.&rsquo; Adam Drewe concluded on
first sight of her that she was a nice woman.
Later on he finds her &lsquo;looking the very
<a name="png.149" id="png.149"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">145</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>incarnation of home, with her cheerful healthy
face, her strong busy hands, her neat hair,
her neat dress&hellip;. She might have sat for
a statue of Motherhood&mdash;of Charity with a
babe at her ample breast, and others clinging
to her supporting hand; Nature had so evidently
intended her to play the part.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Katherine Knowles has fine physical
symmetry and a strong, frank face. While
lacking &lsquo;the airs and graces, the superficial
brightness, of conventional girlhood,&rsquo; she is
&lsquo;singularly vivid in her more substantial
way.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Betty Ochiltree&#8217;s beauty, too, is of the
kind that wears well. She has a face &lsquo;frank
and spirited, firm of mouth and chin, kind
and sweet, as honest as the day,&rsquo; surmounting
an ample body, and she carries herself with
dignity, &lsquo;as few Australian girls can do.&rsquo;
And how impressive and consistent with her
character is the noble, placid figure of
Elizabeth King, &lsquo;perfect in proportion, fine
in texture, full of natural dignity and ease!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The author is fond of showing the attractiveness
of such women at the age of thirty,
<a name="png.150" id="png.150"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">146</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>or even more. &lsquo;In real life,&rsquo; she once
observes, &lsquo;the supremely interesting woman
is not a girl of eighteen, as she is in fiction.
Every man worth calling a man knows that.
A girl of that age &hellip; knows as much about
love as does a young animal in the spring,
and not a bit more. And the human male of
these days&mdash;so highly developed, so subtly
compounded&mdash;has grown out of the stage
when that much would satisfy him. I mean,
of course, the human male who in real life
answers to the hero in fiction&mdash;a man who
must have left, not only his teens, but his
twenties behind him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When one comes to the heroes, it is easy
to recall half a dozen commanding figures
who blunder in the most natural and amiable
manner in their affairs; who think a good
deal more of their immediate personal comforts
than of religious or ethical abstractions;
who like their own way and try to get it;
who, in short, are mostly what the author
wishes them to appear&mdash;&lsquo;the men out of
books that we meet every day.&rsquo; Of little
men, in the physical sense, there are only
<a name="png.151" id="png.151"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">147</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>two of any importance, but even these are
virile and masterful. A general aim of the
stories would seem to be to show the sexes
what each chiefly admires in the other. It
is first a sort of apotheosis of the <i>mens sana
in corpore sano</i>, and after that an illustration
of the independent attractions of sympathy,
gentleness, culture, and high character.</p>

<p>Though in most cases the strongest attachments
are formed between men and women
arrived at an age to discriminate beyond
mere physical charm, nevertheless physical
charm is the most powerful, though not
always acknowledged, motive of their choice.
&lsquo;Because of this,&rsquo; says the pathetic Hilda
Donne in <cite>A Marriage Ceremony</cite>, touching
her cheek, which is terribly disfigured by a
birth-mark, &lsquo;I have never had <em>love</em>. Can
you think what that means? You can&#8217;t.
Once I thought I was not going to be quite
shut out&mdash;once; but I was mistaken. I
have found out that it is for one&#8217;s body that
one is loved, and not for one&#8217;s soul.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Hilda unconsciously exaggerates, for it
appears that Rutherford Hope, though at
<a name="png.152" id="png.152"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">148</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>first affected with disgust by her disfigurement,
and convinced that no healthy man
could consort with &lsquo;so unnatural a woman,&rsquo;
had come at last to regard her as a possible
wife&mdash;before he was confronted with the
sudden temptation to secure a fortune by
wedding Betty Ochiltree, in compliance with
the conditions of her millionaire uncle&#8217;s will.
Yet Hilda&#8217;s comment is substantially sound.
Even Rutherford, with all the sense of his
mature years, and all the culture that enabled
him to appreciate her poetic gift, would
have had to argue himself into a marriage
with her.</p>

<p>The ugliness of Adam Drewe, from which
his mother turned in disgust at his birth,
and which in youth drove him across the
seas in an agony of sensitiveness from the
woman he loved, was a less serious affliction

however, his case is at fault in failing to give
a sufficient description of his deformity. But
that he himself long thought it an insuperable
bar to his happiness is clear. When he
fell in love with Fidelia Plunket, she was
temporarily blind. His affection for her was
returned, and he knew it, but dreading the
disillusionment that would ensue when her
sight was restored, he fled to Australia and
determined to abandon all thought of her as
a wife. Urged to return, because &lsquo;when a
woman <em>is</em> a woman,&rsquo; and really in love with
a man, &lsquo;there&#8217;s no camel she won&#8217;t swallow
for him,&rsquo; Drewe replied that his camel was
just the one camel that no woman had been
known to swallow, or, at any rate, to digest.
And he remained&mdash;for twenty years.</p>

<p>The plots of Ada Cambridge&#8217;s novels are
of the episodical order, and the author, despite
her openly-expressed scorn for the unnaturalness
of the average conventional novel, has
not disdained employment of some of its
time-honoured methods. Occasionally she
is at pains to explain the feasibility of
<a name="png.154" id="png.154"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">150</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>coincidences employed to secure dramatic
interest. They are certainly never of an
impossible kind, and no one would deny the
truism that real life abounds in them. But
has not a distinguished writer aptly pointed
out that there are matters in which fiction
cannot compete with life? As a rule, however,
where a few such weaknesses exist, they
do not count for much with the average
reader when the principal scenes are as
finely drawn as those in <cite>A Marked Man</cite>
or <cite>Fidelis</cite>, or <cite>The Three Miss Kings</cite>. The
latter story in some details puts a greater
strain upon the credulity than any of the
other novels, yet so well conceived and
absolutely natural are the characters of the
three girls, and so humorously and pictorially
presented the chief incidents in their development,
that the dubious points of the plot
become almost insignificant. The qualities
of the novel as a whole are similar to those
which obscure the artistic defects of <cite>Geoffry
Hamlyn</cite>, and which for thirty-seven years
have made it one of the most popular of
Australian stories.</p>

<p><a name="png.155" id="png.155"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">151</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>In the presentation of tragic or pathetic
incidents lies Ada Cambridge&#8217;s chief power,
as far as her plots are concerned. In <cite>A
Marked Man</cite> it is accompanied by her
highest achievements in portraying a variety
of well-contrasted character<!-- TN: sic -->. <cite>Fidelis</cite>, which
opens at the Norfolk village of the earlier
novel, and reintroduces the Delavels, contains
fewer developed characters, as may also be
said of <cite>A Marriage Ceremony</cite>. But the
three novels are equal in the high standard
of their emotional quality. No quotation of
moderate size could do justice to any of the
principal scenes of <cite>A Marked Man</cite>: the
chivalrous sacrifice of Richard Delavel&#8217;s
youthful marriage; the inward repentance
of it for twenty-two years; the revival of his
love for Constance Bethune; his painful
anxiety for her health, hungry enjoyment of
her companionship, and anguish at her death;
and his own death soon afterwards. In the
more briefly detailed tragedy that brings into
such striking relief the sprightly drama of
<cite>A Marriage Ceremony</cite>, there is a scene
giving a fair example of the author&#8217;s style in
<a name="png.156" id="png.156"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">152</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>touching passages. When Hilda, deeply in
love with Rutherford Hope, hears of his
union with another woman, she takes the
readiest means of effacing herself by suddenly
marrying a shallow coxcomb who seeks her
for mercenary reasons, and going with him to
Australia. Years afterwards she is so affected
by the sudden reappearance of Rutherford,
and by subsequent ill-treatment received from
her jealous husband, that an exhausting
illness follows, and to save herself from
insanity she commits suicide. Meanwhile
the long separation of Rutherford and Betty
Ochiltree, which began on the day of their
marriage, is coming to an end, and Hilda&#8217;s
death removes the final impediment. Together
they pay a last visit to the dead
woman:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Incapable of speech, he lifted a tress of hair&mdash;flowing
free over the rigid arms, because it was really pretty, and
thus had to be made the most of&mdash;and pressed it a
moment to his bearded mouth. In that gesture he
seemed to ask her forgiveness for having been a man
like other men, as Nature made them.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Kiss <em>her</em>,&rsquo; Betty whispered, pushing him a little.
She, too, felt that it would be something, if not much,
<a name="png.157" id="png.157"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">153</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>to put to the account that was so frightfully ill-balanced&mdash;a
kiss from Rutherford before all was wholly over.</p>

<p>He stooped and laid his lips&mdash;scarcely laid them&mdash;on
the waxen forehead. And he thought how he had nearly
kissed her once, in the scented spring dusk, at her
father&#8217;s gate, and been repelled at the last moment by
the thought of something that he could not see&hellip;.
He turned back the sheet and straightened it, and
nobody but hired undertakers had anything more to do
with Hilda Donne. He put out the lamps, leaving her
in the dark, which, as a living, nervous woman, she had
always been afraid of; and he took Betty in his arms to
comfort her a little, before he opened the door upon the
light and life of their own transfigured world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a characteristic vein of realism
in the subsequent view of the lovers&#8217; self-absorption
and short-lived sorrow, and the
callousness of Donne.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No later than the same Saturday afternoon [Hilda was
buried in the morning], her Edward was cheering himself
with his preparations for New Zealand, whither he
was easily persuaded to set off at once as a means of
distracting his mind from his domestic woes, and of
retiring gracefully from a Civil Service that was otherwise
certain to dismiss him; and there he shortly found
a number of absorbing interests, including&mdash;as Rutherford
had predicted&mdash;a rosy-cheeked second wife, who, as
he wrote to Mrs. Ochiltree when announcing his engagement,
was all that heart could wish, and had apparently
been made on purpose for him&hellip;. No later than
<a name="png.158" id="png.158"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">154</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Saturday afternoon&mdash;and early at that&mdash;Rutherford,
having parted with the widower and seen him off the
premises, ran upstairs to his wife&#8217;s door, with a spring in
his step and a light in his eyes that plainly showed his
mourning to be over. Hilda was dead and gone, but
Betty was alive in her splendid strength and beauty, and
he was her husband and bridegroom, and his hour had
come! The grave had closed over that broken heart,
which had ached as long as it could feel, and ached
most for him; but the world was still glorious for him
and his love, and never so glorious as now. They began
to bask in their happiness, as the house in the sunshine
that flooded it, now that the blinds were drawn up. The
shadow of death, close and terrible as it was, could not
dim it for them any more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In all the novels there are memorable
scenes of tenderness, among the best of
which are those between Fidelia and Adam
Drewe, first in their brief meetings as girl
and youth&mdash;she with her weak eyes bandaged,
but reading him through his voice and bashful
deprecation; he yearning to remain with
her, but forcing himself away&mdash;and then in
long years after, when he returns to find her
in widowhood and poverty, and to all seeming
hopelessly blind.</p>

<p>The conception of the latter scene is quite
the best to be found in the whole of Ada
<a name="png.159" id="png.159"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">155</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Cambridge&#8217;s work, and has not been equalled
in its kind by any other Australian writer.
The simplicity and verbal reticence of this
chapter of intense feeling gives also a good
sample of the author&#8217;s style of expression.
Seldom ornate or much studied, it is ever a
lucid and easy style. As a narrative specimen,
the following, from the same novel, is
conveniently quotable:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was not much of an accident, but it was enough.
The engine buried its fore-paws in the soft earth of the
embankment, where engines were not meant to go, and
then paused abruptly in the attitude of a little dog hiding
a bone in a flower-bed; the embankment sloped down
instead of up, and the monster hung upon the edge of it,
nose to the ground and hind-quarters in the air, looking
as if a baby&#8217;s touch would send it over. Several carriages,
violently running upon it and being checked suddenly,
stood on tip-toes, so to speak, and fell into each other&#8217;s
arms with a vehemence that completely overset them;
one rolled right down the bank, head first, and the others
tumbled upon its kicking wheels. It was all over in a
moment; and the dazed passengers, realising in a second
moment that the end of the world was still an event in
the future, picked themselves up as best they could. No
one was killed, but some were badly shaken, and most of
them screamed horribly. The sound of those screams,
mingled with the clanking and crashing of riven wood
and metal, and the hissing of escaping steam, conveyed
<a name="png.160" id="png.160"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">156</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the idea of such an appalling catastrophe as would make
history for the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Though not a satirist&mdash;she does not hate
well enough to be that&mdash;Ada Cambridge has
occasionally a neat and forcible way of describing
character. Richard Delavel&#8217;s first
wife was &lsquo;a gentle and complaisant being,
soft and smooth, apparently yielding to the
touch, but dense, square, and solid as a well-dumped
wool-bale.&rsquo; When opposed in will
or contradicted in her opinion, she smiled
resignedly, and, if it appeared due to her
dignity, sulked for a period. Yet generally
she was &lsquo;the evenest-tempered woman that
ever a well-meaning husband found it difficult
to get on with.&rsquo; A pattern of order and
conscientiousness, &lsquo;governed by principles
that were as correct as her manners and
costume, and as firmly established as the
everlasting hills,&rsquo; she might have made an
admirable wife for a clergyman, but was
totally unsuited to Delavel, as he to her.</p>

<p>Still, she was very proud of the look of
&lsquo;blood&rsquo; in her Richard, and when he became
wealthy, and she a fashionable hostess in
<a name="png.161" id="png.161"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">157</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Sydney society, nothing delighted her more
than her opportunities of making the aristocratic
connection known. Her own origin
as the daughter of a farmer was quite
forgotten. &lsquo;Annie might have been a
Delavel from the beginning, in her own
right, for all the recollection that remained
to her of the real character of her bringing
up&hellip;. Years and certain circumstances
will often affect a woman&#8217;s memory that way&mdash;a
man somehow manages to keep a better
grasp of facts.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Yelverton, the lover of Elizabeth King,
an English aristocrat spending some of his
wealth in lessening the misery and vice of
London, was &lsquo;not the orthodox philanthropist,
the half-feminine, half-neuter specialist with
a hobby, the foot-rule reformer, the prig with
a mission to set the world right; his benevolence
was simply the natural expression of a
sense of sympathy and brotherhood between
him and his fellows, and the spirit which
produced that was not limited in any direction.&rsquo;</p>

<p>His friend, Major Duff-Scott, &lsquo;an
<a name="png.162" id="png.162"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">158</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>ex-officer of dragoons, and a late prominent
public man of his colony (he was prominent
still, but for his social and not his official
qualifications), was a well-dressed and well-preserved
old gentleman who, having sown
a large and miscellaneous crop of wild oats
in the course of a long career, had been
rewarded with great wealth, and all the
privileges of the highest respectability.&rsquo;</p>

 /></span>ADAM LINDSAY GORDON.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> strongest note of Adam Lindsay Gordon&#8217;s
poetry is a personal one. When he represents
Australia best, he best represents his own
striking character. Yet that character had
clearly shown itself, as had also his lyric gift,
before he saw Australia. He is the favourite
poet of the country by a happy fortuity
rather than by the merit of special native
inspiration. Those tastes of the people
which he has expressed in manner and
degree so rare as to make a parallel difficult
of conception were also his own dominant
tastes. From early boyhood they had controlled
his life, and in the end they wrecked
it.</p>

<p>That any man living an adventurous and
precarious life, often in rude associations and
<a name="png.164" id="png.164"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">160</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>without the stimulus of ambition or of
intellectual society, should write poetry at
all is a matter for some wonder. And when
several of the compositions of such a writer
are marked by rare vigour and melody, and
some few are worthy to rank with the best of
their kind produced in the century, it must
be held that the gift of the author is genuine
and spontaneous. It is impossible to believe
that Gordon would have been less a poet had
he never lived under the Southern Cross;
that he would have cared less for horses and
wild riding, for manliness and the exhilaration
of danger. Had he become a country gentleman
in England, or a soldier, like his father,
should we not still have had &lsquo;The Rhyme of
Joyous Garde,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Romance of Britomarte,&rsquo;
&lsquo;By Flood and Field,&rsquo; and &lsquo;How we beat
the Favourite.&rsquo; And do these not form the
majority of his best poems? A man apt
alike for the risks of the chase or the cavalry
charge, with a delicate ear for the music of
words, with natural promptings to write,
would in any conditions have found time to
celebrate the things which his daring and
<a name="png.165" id="png.165"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">161</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>gallant spirit loved. Had he not ridden as
well as written the rides related by his &lsquo;Sick
Stockrider,&rsquo; he might have been foremost in
that more glorious one so often present to his
fiery fancy, and have wielded</p>

<blockquote class="pl6">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i6">          &lsquo;The splendid bare sword</div>
<div>Flashing blue, rising red from the blow!&rsquo;</div>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>Gordon was a true soldier in sentiment all
his life, as he was also a true Englishman, and
it is the soldier and the Englishman in him far
more than the Australian that the people of his
adopted country, consciously or unconsciously,
admire. It is yet difficult to consider his
work as a writer apart from his personality.
And it is natural that this should be so in
the case of a man whose career was itself
a romance, who led as strange a double
life as ever poet lived, and who, through all,
retained the marked essentials of a gentleman.</p>

<p>In his character as a sportsman and a rider
there is an element of the ideal which largely
helps to commend him to the majority of
Australians. Though his liking for horses
and the turf became a destroying passion,
<a name="png.166" id="png.166"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">162</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>there was never anything sordid in it. He
was not a gambler, for long after he had
won recognition as the first steeplechase rider
in a country of accomplished riders, he
declined payment for his services on the
race-track, accepting it only when compelled
at last by poverty to do so; and the distaste
with which he had always viewed the meaner
associations of the sport latterly became
dislike and scorn. In the period of disappointment
that preceded his death he
refused a remunerative post on the sporting
staff of a leading Melbourne journal because
he wished to dissociate himself completely
and finally from everything connected with
the professionalism of sport.</p>

<p>As a Bush rider he became noted for the
performance of feats which no one else would
think of attempting. The Australians often
speak and write of it as courage absence of
fear&mdash;but it surely had a large admixture of
pure recklessness. It is at least evident that
danger had a certain irresistible fascination
for him. &lsquo;Name a jump, and he was on fire
to ride at it,&rsquo; is the description given of this
<a name="png.167" id="png.167"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">163</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>curious predilection which made his company
in a riding party a somewhat exciting pleasure.
The day in 1868 when he won three steeplechases
at Melbourne is still remembered;
and at Mount Gambier, in South Australia,
a granite obelisk marks where once he leaped
his horse over a fence surmounting the headland
of a lake, and then across a chasm &lsquo;more
than forty feet wide.&rsquo; A single false step
would have cast horse and rider into the lake
two hundred feet below. Of the same wild
character was his riding during boyhood in
the hunting-fields of Gloucestershire. It
would be natural to suspect some measure of
vanity or bravado in all this, but no hint of
either is given by any of his acquaintances;
and the few who knew him well are emphatic
in placing him, as a man and a sportsman,
apart from and above the majority of those
with whom the conditions of his life brought
him into contact. &lsquo;Gordon,&rsquo; says one of his
intimate friends, &lsquo;was always a quiet, modest,
pure-minded gentleman&hellip;. I never knew
such a noble-hearted man, especially where
women were concerned.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.168" id="png.168"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">164</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>The deep melancholy in many of Gordon&#8217;s
poems has been attributed to the influence of
Australian scenery, and to the loneliness of
the earlier years of his life in the colonies.
This explanation, if not wholly erroneous,
is at least much exaggerated. It ignores the
most obvious elements of the poet&#8217;s temperament.
It takes no account of the history of
wasted opportunities and regrets, of defeat
and discontent, of self-wrought failure and
remorse, that may plainly be read in &lsquo;To my
Sister,&rsquo; &lsquo;An Exile&#8217;s Farewell,&rsquo; &lsquo;Early Adieux,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Whispering in the Wattle Boughs,&rsquo; &lsquo;Quare
Fatigasti,&rsquo; &lsquo;Wormwood and Nightshade,&rsquo; and
other poems. The writer, as he himself says,
has no reserve in the criticism of his own
career.</p>

<p>Gordon&#8217;s youth was wild and ungoverned.
Before his twenty-first year his folly had lost
him home, friends, love, and the one profession
that might have steadied him, as well as
<a name="png.169" id="png.169"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">165</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>afforded him distinction. He was the son of
Captain Adam D. Gordon (an officer who
had seen service in India) and the grandson
of a wealthy Scotch merchant. Captain
Gordon settled at Cheltenham in the later
years of his life, and intended that his son
should study for the army; but a mad wilfulness
and passion for outdoor sport had taken
possession of the youth, and nothing could be
done with him. He rode to hounds with all
the daring that marked his horsemanship in
later life; he rode in steeplechases, he
frequented the company of pugilists at
country fairs and public-houses, and joined
in their contests; he was removed from two
schools for unruly conduct, and a more serious
escapade, though innocent of any bad intention,
nearly caused his arrest by the police.
At last it was agreed that he should emigrate
to Australia. He was glad to go, but bitter
at the thought of what his going implied.
The knowledge that he suffered solely through
his own fault did not make less disagreeable
to him the censure of others, even that of the
gallant father whom, in his wildest moments
<a name="png.170" id="png.170"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">166</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>of rebellion, he never ceased to love and
admire. The unhappiness attending this
severance from the home that he felt he
would never see again is told in a poem to
his sister, written (August, 1853) a few days
before he sailed.</p>

<p>The stanzas (there are ten more in the
poem) have all the bitterness of a youthful
sorrow and all the vigour of a youthful
defiance. But at the moment of his deepest
depression it is upon himself that the writer
casts the real blame. This is characteristic
of his judgment of himself throughout life.
He has ever too much honour and spirit to
shirk the responsibility of his own acts. And
the same qualities keep him from doing injury
to others. He is consoled by remembering
this in bidding good-bye to his native land.</p>

<p>As a colonist, Gordon might have justified
his Scotch descent by making a fortune.
Wealth was to be gained in other and surer
ways than by groping for it in the goldfields.
But he was indifferent, and allowed himself
<a name="png.172" id="png.172"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">168</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>to drift. Australia was attractive to him only
as a place of adventure, of freedom, of retirement,
of oblivion. All but the latter he
found it. He readily adapted himself to the
rough conditions of the country, but could
never overcome the thought that in those
first false steps he had lost all worth striving
for. Time softened the gloomy defiance of
his farewell verses, but did not alter his
determination to efface himself, to be forgotten
even by his family. He held no
communication with anyone in England, and
heard nothing from his home until ten years
later, when a lawyer&#8217;s letter notified him that
both his mother and father were dead, and
that under the will of the latter he was to
receive a legacy of seven thousand pounds.
Meanwhile, Gordon appears to have made
no attempt to win any of the prizes that were
the common reward of pluck and industry in
the Australia of the fifties. He joined the
mounted police force of South Australia, but,
impatient of its discipline, soon left it, and for
long afterwards was content with the rough
employment of a horse-breaker.</p>

time. He broke in horses during the day,
and read the classic poets at night. Think

fustian, and half-Wellington boots, seated
among the boisterous company of a &lsquo;men&#8217;s
hut&rsquo; on a Bush station, reading Horace by
the aid of a rude lamp, &lsquo;consisting of a

as he so finely did, the famous Balaclava
Charge, which set Europe ringing with pity
and admiration a year after he arrived in
Australia. How he would have liked to be
among the actors in that scene!</p>

<blockquote class="pl5">

<div>&lsquo;Oh! the minutes of yonder maddening ride</div>
<div class="i2">  Long years of pleasure outvie!&rsquo;</div>

<p class="noindent">he exclaims, and wishes that his own end
could be fair as that of one &lsquo;who died in his
stirrups there.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Gordon seemed not only to be reconciled
to his Bush life, but to have become attached
to it.  He once declared it to be better in
<a name="png.174" id="png.174"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">170</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>many respects than any other. He was
temperate, skilful in his work, and as popular
as one of reserved manner can be. Most
of the squatters of the period made it a
practice to receive into their social circle any
companionable and educated man, whether
their equal in position or not. It was a
generous custom, typical of the most hospitable
country in the world, and worked
well on the whole. But Gordon, unlike
Henry Kingsley and others of the same
class, took no advantage of it. That the
squatters did not themselves recognise the
worth of one so unassertive was not to be
wondered at. He saw this, and never blamed
them. They could not, as he remarked on
one occasion, be expected to know that he
was as well born as any of them, and perhaps
better educated. One of them saw there was
&lsquo;something above the common&rsquo; in him; but
that was all. At length he was discovered
by a good-natured and scholarly Roman
Catholic priest (the Rev. Julian E. Tenison
Woods), who, though he does not say so,
evidently took a pleasure during the five
<a name="png.175" id="png.175"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">171</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>years of their acquaintance in making the
merits of the solitary Englishman known in
the colony. Their tastes accorded excellently.
They talked &lsquo;horses or poetry&rsquo; as they rode
together, or smoked by their camp-fires.
Gordon&#8217;s reserve thawed for the first time.
He had a well-trained memory, and occasionally
would recite Latin or Greek verse,
or a scene from Shakespeare, or passages
from Byron and other modern poets. Greek
he had taught himself in lonely hours after
his arrival in Australia, having neglected it
while at college.</p>

<p>In the end his disposition left the good
cleric, like many another, much puzzled.
Was there anything of foolish pride or
misanthropy in Gordon&#8217;s avoidance of society
that would have welcomed him? Both his
recorded speech and his poems are without
evidence of either. Those who remember
his taciturnity and little eccentricities also
speak of his kindness of heart, generosity
and trustfulness of others. Did he ever
complain that he was oppressed and saddened
by his self-chosen life in the Bush? We have
<a name="png.176" id="png.176"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">172</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>seen the high estimate he once gave of it;
and Mr. Woods, who has recorded many
proofs of close observation of his friend,
testifies that the melancholy of his poems
found little or no expression in his conversation.
Gordon may have been shy (as Marcus
Clarke noted), but he early formed a fairly
accurate judgment of his literary powers. He
said &lsquo;he was sure he would rise to the top of
the tree in poetry, and that the world should
talk of him before he died.&rsquo; Coming from
one who was far from being vain or boastful,
the remark suggests hope and ambition. But
neither, it would seem from his colonial
career, was ever more than a passing mood
with him. Why did he remain in obscurity
during several of the best years of his life,
doing rough and dangerous work, when he
might have obtained some remunerative post
in one of the cities? Why did he marry a
domestic servant&mdash;one who could never be
an intellectual companion for him?</p>

<p>It appears that he considered himself to
have &lsquo;irretrievably lost caste.&rsquo; It is a
fantastic idea, and could not have any justification
<a name="png.177" id="png.177"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">173</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>in a country where an Englishman of
good manners and behaviour need never
want congenial society. Gordon was abnormally
proud, independent and sensitive:
an unfortunate disposition for anyone who
has his way to make in an imperfect world.
Such a man constantly misunderstands himself
and is misunderstood. He takes severe,
unpractical views of his own character and of
life generally. Not necessarily morose or
ungenial, he is always apt to be thought so.
Gordon&#8217;s conclusion that he had lost caste is
a proof of supersensitiveness, and the deep
effect produced upon his temperament by the
incidents of his youth.</p>

<p>There is a touching and significant little
story of an acquaintance which he formed
with a young lady at Cape Northumberland,
and how he ended it. We are delicately
told that, having become a warm admirer of
his dashing horsemanship, the lady used to
walk in early morning to a neighbouring
field to see him training a favourite mare
over hurdles. Something more than a
mutual liking for horses and racing is plainly
<a name="png.178" id="png.178"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">174</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>hinted at as existing between them. But
after they had met thus a few times, Gordon
asked abruptly whether her mother knew
that she came there every morning to see
him ride. She replied in the negative, adding
that her mother disapproved of racing.
&lsquo;Well, don&#8217;t come again,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;I know
the world, and you don&#8217;t. Good-bye. Don&#8217;t
come again.&rsquo; Surprised and wounded, the
lady silently gave him her hand in farewell.
&lsquo;He looked at it as if it were some natural
curiosity, and said, &ldquo;It&#8217;s the first time I have
touched a lady&#8217;s hand for many a day&mdash;my
own fault, my own fault&mdash;good-bye.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>For a brief period after the receipt of his
father&#8217;s legacy Gordon looked towards his
future with some interest and confidence.
He spoke of a proposal to undertake regular
journalistic work at Melbourne, and to make
an attempt at writing novels. It was at this
time also that he foresaw that he would make
a name as a poet. The people of Mount
Gambier, finding him presently settled as the
owner of a small estate in the district, made
him their representative in the Legislative
<a name="png.179" id="png.179"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">175</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Assembly of South Australia. In this new
character he seems to have achieved only a
reputation for drawing humorous sketches.
Having delivered a few speeches highly
embellished with classical allusions which
failed to make any impression upon the plain
business men of the House, he subsided, and
was afterwards seldom heard. And when
his seat became vacant in due course, he did
not seek re-election. He had been unable
to take his Parliamentary experience seriously.
He is said to have always looked back upon
it as something of a joke.</p>

<p>And now, with a revival of his former
attachment to the excitements and uncertainties
of the turf, begin a series of misfortunes
which pursued him until his death.
His property, mismanaged and neglected,
had to be sold, and he set out a poor man
once more for the adjoining colony of
Victoria. Here, while suffering ill-health
and poverty&mdash;starving in his own proud way&mdash;after
failing in a small business which he had
undertaken, Gordon learned that he would
probably come into possession of the barony
<a name="png.180" id="png.180"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">176</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>of Esselmont in Scotland, then producing an
income of about two thousand pounds a year.
But on further inquiry it was found that his
title to the estate ceased with the abolition
of the entail under the Entail Amendment
Act of 1848. The excitement of his ill-fortune
and the effects of a recent wound on
the head combined to unhinge his mind,
and in June, 1870, at the age of thirty-seven
he ended his life by shooting himself at
Brighton, near Melbourne. In comparing
the impressions of Gordon&#8217;s disposition given
by his friends, it is curious to note that among
the few things in which they agree is an
absence of surprise at his suicide.</p>

<p>It would not be difficult to imagine a more
representative poet in the provincial sense
than Gordon. His description of the colonies
as</p>

<blockquote class="pl5">
<div class="stanza">
<div>&lsquo;Lands where bright blossoms are scentless,</div>
<div class="i2">  And songless bright birds,&rsquo;</div>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">would be strangely misleading were it not
contradicted by other lines from the same
hand, showing a delicate appreciation of the
rugged features of Australian scenery. But
<a name="png.181" id="png.181"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">177</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>he sees them only in passing, or as a symbol
of something he is pondering, or as a contrast
to what he has left behind &lsquo;on far English
ground.&rsquo; No sight or sound of Australian
Nature is a sole subject of any of his poems.
His &lsquo;Whispering in the Wattle Boughs&rsquo; does
not express the voices of the forest, but the
echoes of a sad youth, the yearnings of an
exile; his &lsquo;Song of Autumn&rsquo; is not a song of
autumn, but a forecast of his own death&mdash;a
forecast that was fulfilled. If he ever felt
any enthusiasm for the future nationhood of
Australia, he did not express it. And such
few native legends as there were, he left to
other pens.</p>

<p>In all of his best poems, there is some
central human interest, something that tells
for courage, honour, manly resignation.
When a story does not come readily to his
hand in the new world, he seeks one in the
old. He fondly turns to the spacious days
of the old knighthood, when men drank and
loved deeply, when they were ready to put
happiness or life itself upon a single hazard.
The subjects that Gordon best liked were
<a name="png.182" id="png.182"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">178</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>short dramatic romances, which he found it
easier to evolve from literature than from
the life and history of his adopted country.
Beyond the compositions upon the national
sport of horse-racing, the only noteworthy
Australian subjects in his three slender
volumes are &lsquo;The Sick Stockrider&#8217;s Review of
the Excitements and Pleasures of a Careless
Bush Life, and his Pathetic Self-satisfaction&rsquo;;
&lsquo;The Story of a Shipwreck&rsquo;; &lsquo;Wolf and
Hound,&rsquo; which describes a duel between the
hunted-down bushranger and a trooper; and
some verses on the death of the explorer
Burke. &lsquo;Ashtaroth,&rsquo; an elaborate attempt
at a sustained dramatic lyric in the manner
of Goethe&#8217;s &lsquo;Faust&rsquo; and &lsquo;Manfred,&rsquo; fills one
of the three volumes, and among shorter
pieces in the other two are more than a dozen
suggested by the poet&#8217;s reading, by his recollections
of English life, and, in a notable
instance, by one of the most memorable of
modern European wars.</p>

<p>In a dedication prefixed to the <cite>Bush
Ballads</cite>, Gordon suggests some of the local
sources of his inspiration. He obviously
overstates his obligations to the country.
<a name="png.183" id="png.183"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">179</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Some of the best of the poems in this,
the most characteristic collection of his work,
have no association with it whatever. &lsquo;The
Sick Stockrider,&rsquo; &lsquo;From the Wreck,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Wolf and Hound&rsquo; are colonial experiences,
finely described. But most of the remaining
poems, while they owe something to Tennyson,
Browning, and Swinburne, are not in
any sense Australian.</p>

<p>But where, save in the retrospect of &lsquo;The

is rather absurd to place with <cite>Bush Ballads</cite>

the old tragedy of Arthur and Launcelot;
the story of seventeenth-century siege and
gallantry in the &lsquo;Romance of Britomarte&rsquo;;

is indeed one galloping rhyme&mdash;&lsquo;How we

a spirit and swiftness of colour, not approached

</blockquote>

<p>It was by this piece, according to Marcus
Clarke, that the poet&#8217;s early reputation was
made.  &lsquo;Intensely nervous, and feeling much
<a name="png.186" id="png.186"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">182</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>of that shame at the exercise of the higher
intelligence which besets those who are
known to be renowned in field sports,
Gordon produced his poems shyly, scribbled
them on scraps of paper, and sent them
anonymously to magazines. It was not
until he discovered one morning that everybody
knew a couplet or two of &ldquo;How we
beat the Favourite&rdquo; that he consented to
forego his anonymity and appear in the unsuspected
character of a verse-maker.&rsquo; Even
in this picture of the excitements of the turf,
there is nothing that would not be as true of
Epsom or Ascot as of Randwick or Flemington.
Yet, it <em>is</em> Australian in the sense that it
expresses the one taste which, of all those inherited
by the people from their British
ancestors, seems never likely to be lost (as
it was by the American colonists)&mdash;which,
on the contrary, has gained in ardour in the
new land. Gordon was a pronounced
believer in the efficacy of field sports as a
means of maintaining the nerve and hardihood
of the race. In one of his minor pieces
he vigorously affirms that</p>

<blockquote class="pl6">

<p>With him the fearless huntsman makes the
fearless soldier. Both are to be cultivated
and admired, and when the latter dies needlessly,
as at Balaclava, we are to be none the
less proud of him,</p>

<blockquote class="pl7">
<div class="stanza">
<div>&lsquo;As a type of our chivalry.&rsquo;</div>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>Of the longer poems, the two best in
artistic quality are &lsquo;The Rhyme of Joyous
Garde&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Sick Stockrider.&rsquo; They
afford a complete contrast in subject, tone
and treatment. The old Arthurian story is
the finer and more finished. There is a
nobility in its expression not elsewhere
equalled by the author. But the other poem
is more direct and simple in its pathos, more
easily understood. It tells something of
familiar experience in language irresistibly
touching and musical. It would be interesting
and a favourite if only through the
obvious fact that it describes in part some of
Gordon&#8217;s own early life.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>&lsquo;The Rhyme of Joyous Garde&rsquo; loses in
appreciation by assuming familiarity on the
part of the reader with all the details of the
story.  It is too allusive.  It is a description
<a name="png.189" id="png.189"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">185</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>more of Launcelot&#8217;s remorse than of the
crime which occasions it. As to the other
classic themes, they probably avail as little
to the reputation of the author as did the
elegant quotations which he inflicted upon
the South Australian legislators. &lsquo;He talked
of the Danai, whilst they were vastly more
interested in the land valuators.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Gordon&#8217;s work was introduced to the
English public by an article in <cite>Temple Bar</cite>
in 1884, and in 1888 a short memoir of him,
entitled <cite>The Laureate of the Centaurs</cite> (now
out of print), was published. Since then his
poems have become known throughout the
English-speaking world. Is this because he
is called an Australian poet&mdash;because people
wish to learn something of Australian life
from his pages? Do English readers ever
ask for the poems of Harpur, or Henry
Kendall, or Brunton Stephens? No;
Gordon&#8217;s poems are admired for the human
interest in them; for what they tell of tastes
and personal qualities dear to the pleasure-loving
and fighting Briton in whatever land
he may be.  It is the sort of admiration that
<a name="png.190" id="png.190"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">186</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>finds fit expression when an English officer
and artist makes a present to the publishers
of a spirited and valuable set of drawings to
illustrate the poem of the Balaclava Charge.
No other Australian poet has yet found
entrance to the great popular libraries of
England. Kendall, who almost deserves to
be called the Australian Shelley, tells more
of Nature in one of his graceful pages than
can be found in a volume of his contemporary.
But his thoughts are too remote from the
common interests of life; and of his own
character he has recorded only what is sad
and painful. For the rest, his brief history
seems to prove that scarce any service may
be less noticed or thanked in Australia than
the describing of its natural beauties or the
writing of its national odes.</p>

<p>Gordon has more than once been misrepresented
with respect to his religious
views. He has been called an agnostic, an
atheist, even a pagan. Passages in nearly a
score of his poems must be read and compared
before an opinion can properly be
given on the point. That he was a doubter,
<a name="png.191" id="png.191"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">187</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>and to some extent a fatalist, appears certain;
but there is nothing to support the charge of
atheism. He shows a very clear conception
of the Christian ideas respecting right and
wrong, and of the Divine mercy, but hesitates
to accept any theories of punishment in a
future state. His general attitude is one of
hope, and of desire to believe. He often
thinks&mdash;too often&mdash;of the transiency<!-- TN: original reads "transciency" --> of life,
and of the question to be solved &lsquo;beyond the
dark beneath the dust.&rsquo; But there is no
despair. And meanwhile his practical creed is</p>

<blockquote class="pl7">
<div class="stanza">
<div>&lsquo;Question not, but live and labour</div>
<div class="i2">  Till yon goal be won,</div>

<div class="i2">  <span class="smcap">Courage</span> in your own.&rsquo;</div>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>It conveys at once the highest and truest
of the many views he has given of his own
character. Generous to others, he was too
seldom just to himself. It was well there
remained among the friends he left behind a
few who knew him for what he was, and who
<a name="png.192" id="png.192"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">188</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>were unwilling that qualities often clouded
during his life by an unhappy temperament
should be undervalued or forgotten. Kendall&#8217;s
&lsquo;In Memoriam&rsquo; is a worthy tribute, and
finely summarizes the general impression of
Gordon which one obtains from his verse:</p>

 /></span>ROLF BOLDREWOOD.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">English</span> readers of Rolf Boldrewood&#8217;s novels
have often wondered why he has ignored in
his writings the modern social life of Australia.
He has a unique knowledge of the country
extending over sixty years, but his literary
materials have been drawn only from the
first half of this period. No other purely
Australian novelist has succeeded in making
a considerable reputation without feeling the
necessity of fleeing to the more congenial
atmosphere of literary London.</p>

<p>It is true that even he had to find acceptance
at home through the circuitous
route of the press and the libraries of Great
Britain, but he was able to wait for his long-delayed
popularity, and when it came and
found him in advanced age, he had no
<a name="png.194" id="png.194"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">190</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>inclination to leave the land of his adoption.
Probably if literature had been to him more
of a profession and less of a taste and
pastime, he would long ago have felt inclined
to turn his back upon the indifference with
which the colonies usually treat their own
products in authorship until English approval
has imparted new virtues to them.</p>

<p>Most of the other writers who have contributed
to the portrayal of a certain few
aspects of Antipodean life have gone to
London or elsewhere. Many years absent
from Australia, they know little of its later
developments. Boldrewood has spent a long
and eventful life there. Of the southern half
of the continent he must possess a specially
intimate knowledge. Melbourne he has
known in all the stages of its growth from a
canvas-built hamlet to the finest city in the
Southern Hemisphere. When he saw it first,
the great golden wealth of the country lay
unsuspected, and Ballarat and Bendigo were
not.</p>

<p>Though English by birth, he is wholly
Australian in training and experience.  In
<a name="png.195" id="png.195"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">191</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>1830, being then four years old, he was taken
by his parents to Sydney, and there educated.
Early in youth he became one of the pioneer
squatters of Western Victoria, sharing with a
few others the danger of dispossessing the
aboriginals, and soon acquiring considerable
wealth. But some years later, going back to
New South Wales, and venturing to establish
himself there on a larger scale as a sheep-owner,
he was involved in a disastrous
drought and lost nearly everything.</p>

<p>In <cite>The Squatters Dream</cite>, which is understood
to be partly autobiographical, he has
minutely recorded the varying fortunes of
pastoral life in the colonies. But the bitterness
of failure never caused him to forget the
happiness of his young enthusiasm, or to
speak ill of a pursuit so much identified with
the prosperity of the country. He refers to
it as &lsquo;that freest of all free lives, that
pleasantest of all pleasant professions&mdash;the
calling of a squatter.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Abandoning his ambition to rank with the
wool-kings, he entered the Civil Service
as a police magistrate and gold-fields
<a name="png.196" id="png.196"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">192</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>commissioner. In these combined offices he
spent twenty-five years, and, while continuing
a good public servant, contrived, like Anthony
Trollope, to find time for substantial work in
literature. Though during a period of about
twenty years he contributed several stories
and other literary matter to the Sydney and
Melbourne press, it was not until the publication
of <cite>Robbery under Arms</cite>, at London in
1889, that his work obtained due recognition
even in the colonies. Ten years earlier he
had made an unsuccessful bid for an English
reputation by the publication of <cite>Ups and
Downs</cite>, the novel which, under the more
attractive title of <cite>The Squatter&#8217;s Dream</cite>,
reappeared in 1890 as a successor to the
famous bushranging story. That the spirited
opening chapters of <cite>Robbery under Arms</cite>
should have been thought lightly of by
Australian editors when the serial rights of
the story were offered to them is somewhat
astonishing. The author has related how
these chapters were successively rejected by
a number of the leading journals, including
two of the best weeklies.</p>

<p><a name="png.197" id="png.197"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">193</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>At length the manuscript was read by Mr.
Hugh George, manager of the <cite>Sydney
Morning Herald</cite> and the <cite>Sydney Mail</cite>, who
promptly accepted it for publication in the
latter newspaper.</p>

<p>Boldrewood at this time (1880) was well
known to the Australian press. It must,
however, be pointed out in justice to the
editors, whom his story failed to impress,
that his previous work had revealed little
of the dramatic sense that contributed so
materially to his success in presenting the
careers of his highwaymen. But it is less
easy to see why, when the full possibilities of
the story had been realised, there should
have remained a second difficulty, that of
securing a publisher to issue it in book form.
&lsquo;An Australian house,&rsquo; the author has said,
&lsquo;refused to undertake the risk;&rsquo; and he adds,
&lsquo;as a matter of fact I had to publish it partly
on my own account in England.&rsquo; This proof
of his confidence in the attractions of the
story has since been justified by its complete
success throughout the English-speaking
world.</p>

<p><a name="png.198" id="png.198"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">194</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>A writer with so much experience of
Australia, and continuing to reside in it,
cannot be surprised if he is expected to take
a large share of responsibility for the fact
that Australian fiction&mdash;the fiction produced
by writers known to the British public&mdash;only
in a slight degree reflects the most interesting
features in the present-day life of the country.
At the same time, no such considerations can
detract from the sterling merits of Rolf Boldrewood&#8217;s
actual services to Australian literature.
It is hardly possible to believe that the
English people still prefer to look to Australia
only for stories of adventure; but if
they do&mdash;and as the first to welcome and appreciate
colonial writers they are perhaps entitled
to exercise a choice&mdash;it is well that such
stories be written from complete local knowledge,
and thus at least correctly describe the
broader aspects of the country.</p>

<p>If Boldrewood were asked to explain his
silence respecting Antipodean life of the
present day, he might reply that the novel
of modern manners did not form any part of
the work which he had chosen to do. At
<a name="png.199" id="png.199"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">195</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>all events, he could claim to be as much a
historian as a novelist. It has been his
ambition to describe Australia chiefly as he
saw it in his youth, about forty years ago&mdash;as
it was immediately before and after the
discovery of gold. That his record <i>per se</i> is
strikingly vivid and faithful is the first general
impression which his novels make upon the
reader, whether English or colonial. There
is about them much of that air of &lsquo;rightness&rsquo;
which Hall Caine has noted to be one of the
most enduring qualities of good fiction, whatever
its literary style may be. They are
cheerful, virile, soundly moral, and take far
more account of the good than of the bad in
human nature. There is no fondness of the
sensational for its own sake. The conditions
of probability are observed with a closeness
which, in books dependent for their interest
so largely upon plot and incident, amounts
almost to a fault.</p>

<p>An English historian is said to have declared
that he would willingly exchange a
library full of the poets for a single good
novel of the period in which he was
<a name="png.200" id="png.200"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">196</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>interested. One can readily imagine that if a
generation or two hence there should be any
Australian history left unwritten, any unsatisfied
curiosity concerning the simple
annals now so familiar to us, Rolf Boldrewood&#8217;s
novels might be found, within their
limits, a more satisfying source of information
than all the rest of contemporary
Australian literature combined, the formal
chroniclers included, as well as the poets:
that is to say, the general view they would
furnish of certain features of pioneer life
would be fuller and clearer, and, minor
details apart, more reliable than could be
gathered from any other source.</p>

<p>Where is there in the elaborate histories
of Rusden, Lang, Blair, and Flanagan, or in
any of the numerous books of sketches and
reminiscences written by persons who have
visited or temporarily resided in Australia, a
view of the picturesque variety, colour, and
splendid energy of the great first race for
gold to compare with that given in the second
volume of <cite>The Miner&#8217;s Right</cite>, or with the
memorable account of what Starlight and
<a name="png.201" id="png.201"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">197</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the Marstons saw at Turon during their
temporary retirement from the highway?</p>

<p>Boldrewood, in these descriptions, has
done what Henry Kingsley, with his more
eloquent pen, if slighter personal experience,
unaccountably neglected, and what Charles
Reade, though he never saw Australia, vividly
imagined, and regretted his inability to fully
employ. Reade saw a theme for a great epic
&lsquo;in the sudden return of a society far more
complex, artificial, and conventional than
Pericles ever dreamed of, to elements more
primitive than Homer had to deal with; in
this, with its novelty and nature and strange
contrasts; in the old barbaric force and native
colour of the passions as they burst out undisguised
around the gold; in the hundred
and one personal combats and trials of cunning;
in a desert peopled and cities thinned
by the magic of cupidity; in a huge army
collected in ten thousand tents, not as heretofore
by one man&#8217;s constraining will, but each
human unit spurred into the crowd by his
own heart; in the &ldquo;siege of gold&rdquo; defended
stoutly by rock and disease; in the world-wide
<a name="png.202" id="png.202"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">198</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>effect of the discovery, the peopling of
the earth at last according to Heaven&#8217;s long-published
and resisted design.&rsquo;</p>

<p>If Boldrewood had not himself realized the
literary value of the stirring scenes in which
his youth was passed, this summary of the
English novelist, published in 1856, might
well have suggested it to him. How far has
he succeeded in commemorating those scenes,
and in what directions chiefly?</p>

<p>In the first place, it is the pictorial, the
literal, not the philosophical, aspect of the
subject which has most attracted him. There
is a personal zest in his remembrance of the
general animation of the scene, a keen sense
of the pleasurable excitement, freedom and
good-fellowship of the life. His books are
essentially men&#8217;s books. This is the universal
report of the English libraries. Analytical
subtleties there are none. Boldrewood is
not given to weighing moonbeams. His
nearest approach to psychology consists in
noting the various effects of robust, unconventional
colonial life upon fortune-seekers
and visitors from the mother country.  This
<a name="png.203" id="png.203"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">199</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>has been a favourite theme with all Australian
writers, and one of which the female novelists
have so far made the most effective use. One
could wish that Boldrewood had made himself
as far as possible an exception to the
rule&mdash;that he had aimed at a praiseworthy
provinciality by matching with the elaborate
minuteness of his local colour some finished
and memorable studies of Australian character.</p>

<p>Maud Stangrove in <cite>The Squatter&#8217;s Dream</cite>,
and Antonia Frankston in <cite>The Colonial Reformer</cite>,
who seem to offer the best opportunities
to typify Australian womanhood, are
gracefully described; but, save for an occasional
longing to relieve the monotony of
their lives by a taste of European travel and
culture, they are indistinguishable from such
purely English types as Ruth Allerton and
Estelle Challoner. Very pathetic, and marked
by some distinctively Antipodean traits, is
the sister of the bushrangers in <cite>Robbery under
Arms</cite>. Aileen Marston has the strong self-reliance
and independence which are born of
the exigencies, as well as of the free life, of
<a name="png.204" id="png.204"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">200</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the country. She and her brothers represent
much of what is best in Boldrewood&#8217;s
portrayal of native character. Maddie and
Bella Barnes and Miss Falkland in the same
novel, Kate Lawless in <cite>Nevermore</cite>, and Possie
Barker in <cite>A Sydneyside Saxon</cite>, are also
Antipodeans, but are only lightly sketched.</p>

<p>Boldrewood claims that in his writings he
has always upheld the Australian character.
It is a fact that he has incidentally done this
to a considerable extent, but not by any
notable portraiture. In the period with which
the novels deal the population of the colonies
was largely English; it was, therefore, perhaps
only natural that the stranger and
adventurer from the Old World, so often
well born and cultured, should prove a more
attractive study than the sons of the soil.
Moreover, the latter, in their monotonous
and circumscribed life, lacked much of the
mystery and romance so vital to the novel of
adventure. But when this has been admitted
in Boldrewood&#8217;s favour, there still remains a
broader charge to which he is liable.</p>

<p>He has been accused, and it must be
<a name="png.205" id="png.205"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">201</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>confessed with a good deal of justice, of paying
too little attention in later novels (taking the
order of their publication in London) to the
development of even those characters most
concerned in his plots. The fault is purely
one of judgment. It is hardly possible to
suppose any lack of ability in a writer who
has produced the bright and suggestive
dialogue scattered through the pages of
<cite>Robbery under Arms</cite> and The <cite>Miner&#8217;s
Right</cite>. Giving rein to his passion for reminiscence
and descriptive detail, he has paid
the inevitable penalty of a loss in human
interest. So obvious is this loss in the stories
of pastoral life, that one is almost fain to
assume it to be the result of deliberate choice.
How far the author, in this section of his
writing, has neglected the social and dramatic
possibilities of country life, can be judged by
noting Mrs. Campbell Praed&#8217;s work in <cite>The
Head Station</cite>, <cite>Policy and Passion</cite>, or <cite>The
Romance of a Station</cite>. But the best contrast
to Boldrewood&#8217;s style is furnished by the
author of <cite>Geoffry Hamlyn</cite>.</p>

<p>Henry Kingsley decided the movement of
<a name="png.206" id="png.206"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">202</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>his characters with a loving care. Their
interests were paramount to him. They
made their own story; the story did not
make them. Their author cared little for
the externals of Australian life except in so
far as they helped to tell something, especially
something good, of his leading personages.
His interest in them was not semi-scientific,
like that of Thackeray or Jane
Austen, Howells or Henry James, in their
studies of human nature; it was that mainly
of a sympathiser and a partisan.</p>

<p>His frequently expressed anxiety about the
impression they were making upon the reader
was not always an affectation. There is a
real solicitude in the confidences concerning
William Ravenshoe upon his sudden promotion
from the stable to the drawing-room
of Ravenshoe Manor. &lsquo;I hope you like
this fellow, William,&rsquo; he says in one place,
and then there is a naïve enumeration of
some of the ex-groom&#8217;s social deficiencies.
This, at best, is a useless interruption of the
story, but it helps, with other signs, to show
Kingsley&#8217;s constant interest in his characters.</p>

<p><a name="png.207" id="png.207"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">203</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Nearly everything in his descriptions of
Australian squatting pursuits is intended to
have a definite and notable bearing upon
them. Thus, the view we get of the drafting-yard
at Garoopna, with Sam Buckley in torn
shirt, dust-covered, and wielding a deft pole
on the noses of the terrified cattle, is not presented
as a piece of station-life so much as a
picturesque means of leading Alice Brentwood
into an involuntary display of her affection
for Sam when he is struck down before
her eyes.</p>

<p>Again, the description of the kangaroo-hunt,
given in the same novel, is remembered
chiefly on account of the picture of Sam and
Alice in the frank enjoyment of their first
love as they loiter in the tracks of the sportsmen,
and, relinquishing the chase with happy
indifference, go home and sit together under
the verandah.</p>

<p>Kingsley avoided the fault, common to his
successors, of exaggerating the interest which
readers are supposed to take in the general
aspects of life in a new country. He had
a keen sense of the value of picturesque
<a name="png.208" id="png.208"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">204</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>environment, but wisely contrived that
nothing should withdraw attention from the
progress of his drama. He was ever on the
watch for opportunities to sketch in lightly
and humorously small traits of character, and
to emphasise salient ones. &lsquo;She had an
imperial sort of way of man&oelig;uvring a frying-pan,&rsquo;
he says, in allusion to the cheerful
adaptability of the high-bred Agnes Buckley,
that fine model of English womanhood,
during her first rough experiences in Australia.
When Hamlyn comes to Baroona
from the neighbouring station to spend
Christmas with his old friends, he finds the
same lady &lsquo;picking raisins in the character
of a duchess.&rsquo; Considered apart from the
story, these Dickensian touches might seem
merely humorous exaggeration, but to those
who have traced the development of Mrs.
Buckley&#8217;s character, how happy and pregnant
they are!</p>

<p><cite>Robbery under Arms</cite> not only contains
Boldrewood&#8217;s most dramatic plot, but his most
skilful and sympathetic treatment of character.
It is a distinct exception to the rest of his
<a name="png.209" id="png.209"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">205</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>work. In the later stories the characters are
brightly sketched, but with so casual a touch
that they leave no permanent impression
with the reader. The best excite no more
than a passing admiration, whereas Kingsley&#8217;s
win lasting admiration and love. There can
be no surer test of art and truth: it furnishes
the one indubitable proof of clear vision,
sympathy, and correct expression. Where
the weakness of some of Boldrewood&#8217;s characters
is not due to deficiency of interest in
them on the part of the author, it is the
result of an attempt to copy life with an
accuracy which sacrifices picturesqueness.</p>

<p>The attempt to preserve absolute truth in
every detail of the life-story of John Redgrave,
the hero of <cite>The Squatter&#8217;s Dream</cite>,
seems distinctly a case in point. In no other
novel is there so complete a description of
Australian squatting life&mdash;its varying success
and failure, its solid comforts and wholesome
happiness in times of prosperity. Redgrave
is one of the most elaborately drawn of all
the author&#8217;s characters; there is the fullest
sense of probability in every incident; the
<a name="png.210" id="png.210"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">206</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>entire story is plainly a direct transcript of
life; nothing at first seems wanting. But
when the book is laid aside, the reader
realises that he has scarcely been once moved
by it. He has felt a transient pity for the
hero&#8217;s misfortunes, and a mild satisfaction at
his modified ultimate success&mdash;nothing more.</p>

<p>The main defect here appears to consist in
the central motive of Redgrave&#8217;s struggles
being limited to purely personal ambition.
His aim is no higher than that of a speculator
in a hurry to be rich, and when he fails, he
gets little more than the sympathy which is
commonly given to the man who plays for a
high stake and loses. His love for Maud
Stangrove, which might have been made a
controlling and ennobling influence, ranks
only as an incident. It comes after the main
impression of his character has been given.
Beyond doubt he represents a real type; no
error has been made in this respect; his
failure to win higher favour with us arises
from his too close approximation to the
common clay. There is absent just that
small element of the ideal with which even
<a name="png.211" id="png.211"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">207</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the sternest of the apostles of realism in
letters have found it impracticable to dispense.</p>

<p>An illustration of how little Boldrewood
was inclined to idealise either his characters
or their surroundings is afforded by the
account of Redgrave&#8217;s first visit to the home
of the Stangroves, his neighbours on the
Warroo. On the journey he passed a Bush
inn of the period where drunkenness was the
normal condition of everyone, from the owner
to the stable-boy. The shanty itself, an ugly
slab building roofed with corrugated iron,
&lsquo;stood as if dropped on the edge of the bare
sandy plain.&rsquo; It faced the dusty track which
did duty as a highroad; at the back of the
slovenly yard was the river, chiefly used as a
receptacle for rubbish and broken bottles. A
half-score of gaunt, savage-looking pigs lay
in the verandah or stirred the dust and
bones in the immediate vicinity of the front-entrance.
&lsquo;What, in the name of wonder,&rsquo;
inquired Jack of himself as he rode away,
&lsquo;can a man do who lives in such a fragment
of Hades <em>but</em> drink?&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.212" id="png.212"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">208</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>The home of the Stangroves, though less
depressing, bears painful evidence of its
isolation. The settler&#8217;s wife little resembles
Agnes Buckley&mdash;she is too typically colonial
for that. &lsquo;She was young, but a certain
worn look told of the early trials of matronhood.
Her face bore silent witness to the
toils of housekeeping with indifferent servants
or none at all; to the want of average female
society; to a little loneliness and a great deal
of monotony.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The visitor meets another member of the
household, Stangrove&#8217;s unmarried sister, a
beautiful and spirited young woman whose
impatience with her colourless life is outwardly
subdued to ironical resignation.
&lsquo;Another eventful day for Mr. Redgrave,&rsquo;
she remarks on his return after a day&#8217;s
riding over the station with her brother;
&lsquo;yesterday the sheep were lost&mdash;to-day the
sheep are found; so passes our life on the
Warroo.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The best argument against Boldrewood&#8217;s
usual treatment of character is furnished by
the great bushranger chief who is the central
<a name="png.213" id="png.213"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">209</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>figure in <cite>Robbery under Arms</cite>. The author
here submits for the first and only time to
that fundamental law of fiction which
demands a certain judicious exaggeration in
the characters of a story depending for its
interest mainly on the charm of circumstance.
Starlight is at once the most real
and least possible personage to be found in
any of Boldrewood&#8217;s novels. He becomes
real because his character and actions are
conceived in harmony with the romance and
pathos of the story. Though it is obvious
enough that there never could have existed a
bushranger with quite so much of the <i>bel air</i>,
or with a private code of honour so admirable,
the exaggeration is far from obtrusive. He
is of a stature suited to the deeds he performs,
and, both he and his exploits being often
closely associated with historical facts, a strong
sense of reality is maintained.</p>

<p>Starlight seems to be a compound of
several characters. He has Turpin&#8217;s ubiquity,
Claude Duval&#8217;s <i>sang-froid</i>, the personal attractiveness
of Gardiner (leader of a gang
which made a business of robbing gold-escorts
<a name="png.214" id="png.214"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">210</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>in New South Wales about forty
years ago), and the humorous daredevilry of
the &lsquo;Captain Thunderbolt&rsquo; who obtained
notoriety in the same colony a few years
later.</p>

<p>Boldrewood seems to have shrewdly agreed
with the dictum of Turpin, that it is necessary
for a highwayman, at all events a captain of
highwaymen, to be a gentleman.  But Starlight,
unlike Turpin, does not become vain
with success, and is far from being enamoured
with his profession. Indeed, he is quite with
the orthodox view of it. He is a bushranger,
apparently, because he no longer hopes or
desires to resume his rank in certain aristocratic
circles from which, by occasional hints,
we are informed that he has fallen.  He
indulges in no lugubrious moralisings&mdash;he is
far too agreeable a person for that&mdash;but
exhibits just the required touch of romance
by letting you know that in his past there is
a sadness which a career of excitement and
danger is necessary to enable him to forget.
Having been won over as a sympathiser and
admirer, the reader is ready to believe that
<a name="png.215" id="png.215"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">211</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>at worst the dashing outlaw could never have
been a very bad fellow. Certainly the author
has carefully kept him from participation in
the grosser acts of lawlessness of which his
revengeful old partner Ben Marston, the more
typical bushranger, is guilty. Cattle-stealing
and highway robbery as supervised by
Starlight are allowable, and even meritorious,
in so far as they afford him opportunities to
practise some facetious deception on the
police. Such raids are not crimes, but
comedies.</p>

<p>There is excellent fun in his posing as
&lsquo;Charles Carisforth, Esq., of Sturton, Yorkshire,
and Banda, Waroona and Ebor Downs,
N.S.W.,&rsquo; while awaiting the arrival at Adelaide
of the 1,100 head of stolen cattle, or
as the &lsquo;Hon. Frank Haughton,&rsquo; one of &lsquo;the
three honourables&rsquo; on the Turon gold-field.
The rash daring and cleverness of these disguises
furnish a combination of amusement
and dramatic interest not approached in anything
else that Boldrewood has written.
Starlight&#8217;s presence at dinner with the gold-fields
commissioner and police magistrate at
<a name="png.216" id="png.216"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">212</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Turon, when &lsquo;in walked Inspector Goring,&rsquo;
the officer who had been so long and patiently
seeking him elsewhere, and his appearance
at Bella Barnes&#8217;<!-- TN: original reads "Barns'" --> wedding, after a reward of
a thousand pounds has been offered for his
capture, are scenes which remain vivid in the
memory long after the more commonplace
adventures of the lords of Terrible Hollow
have lost their distinctness or been forgotten.</p>

<p>Next to his humour and courage, the
qualities which most endear this picturesque
marauder to the reader are the happy fierceness
with which he commands the respect of
his retainers, and his politeness and gallantry
to women. When a robbery is to be effected,
the plans are laid with sound generalship, but
there is no unnecessary violence or loss of
good manners. His conduct at the plundering
of the gold-escort is fully equal to the
traditional suavity of Claude Duval. &lsquo;Now,
then, all aboard!&rsquo; he calls out to the passengers
when the contents of the coach have
been removed. &lsquo;Get in, gentlemen; our
business matters are concluded for the night.
Better luck next time! William, you had
<a name="png.217" id="png.217"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">213</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>better drive on. Send back from the next
stage, and you will find the mail-bags under
that tree. They shall not be injured more
than can be helped.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The bushranger of real life, as known to
the pioneer colonist, would have bagged his
booty with much fewer words. That Starlight
should have &lsquo;treated all women as if
they were duchesses,&rsquo; and have made it a
point of honour to keep his pledged word
with them, in however slight a matter, seems
only natural. Not even the women-folk of
his enemy are allowed to want a protector.
When Moran and his gang of ruffians take
possession of Darjallook station during the
absence of the male members of the household,
Starlight and the Marstons ride twenty
miles across country and rescue the ladies
before the worst has been done. Starlight
bows to them &lsquo;as if he was just coming into
a ball-room,&rsquo; and, retiring, raises Miss Falkland&#8217;s
hand to his lips like a knight of old.</p>

<p>These passages are only a few of the
many which might be cited to show how far
the author, fired with the spirit and romance
<a name="png.218" id="png.218"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">214</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>of the story, gave freedom to his imagination
in shaping the proportions of his leading
character. Starlight, though he is not, and
cannot be, a portrait of any single colonial
outlaw of real life, is sufficiently natural to
consistently represent in both his conduct
and adventures much that was typical of
Australian bushranging forty years ago and
later.</p>

<p>Some of his characteristics, and at least
one of the concluding episodes of the story,
were suggested by the career of a New South
Wales horse-stealer who became known as
&lsquo;Captain Moonlight.&rsquo; So much is certain.
Boldrewood has himself narrated to a contributor
of the Australian <cite>Review of Reviews</cite>
his recollections of Moonlight and his end:
&lsquo;Among other horses he stole was a mare
called Locket, with a white patch on her
neck. We had all seen her. This was the
horse that brought about his downfall, and
he was actually killed on the Queensland
border in the way I have described in <cite>Robbery
under Arms</cite>. Before that, Moonlight had
had some encounters with Sergeant Wallings
<a name="png.219" id="png.219"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">215</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>(Goring); and this day, when Wallings rode
straight at him, he said: &ldquo;Keep back, if
you&#8217;re wise, Wallings.  I don&#8217;t want your
blood on my head; but if you <span class="nw">must&mdash;&mdash;</span>&rdquo;
But Wallings rode at him at a gallop. Two
of the troopers fired point-blank at Moonlight,
and both shots told. He never moved,
but just lifted his rifle. Wallings threw up
his arms, and fell off his horse a dying man.
As Moonlight was sinking, the leader of the
troopers said: &ldquo;Now you may as well tell
us what your name is.&rdquo; But he shook his
head, and died with the secret.&rsquo; He was
&lsquo;a gentlemanly fellow,&rsquo; probably one of that
unhappy class of young Englishmen of good
birth and no character who are exiled to the
colonies for their sins, and there often acquire
new vices or sink into obscurity.</p>

<p>When Archibald Forbes was in New
Zealand a few years ago, he met a peer&#8217;s son
who was earning his &lsquo;tucker&rsquo; as a station-cook.
A Chinaman, aspiring to better things,
had vacated the billet in his favour! It is
interesting to note the use Boldrewood makes
in his novel of the suggestion afforded by
<a name="png.220" id="png.220"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">216</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the bushranger&#8217;s concealment of his identity.
When Starlight is overcome in his last
attempt at escape, the curiosity long felt
concerning his past life seems for the third
time in the story about to be gratified. But
the reader is once more and finally disappointed.
The bushranger has given his last
messages, and is dying with some of the
indifference to existence which has characterised
him throughout the story.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;I say, Morringer, do you remember the last pigeon-match
you and I shot in, at Hurlingham?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why, good God!&rsquo; says Sir Ferdinand, bending down,
and looking into his face. &lsquo;It can&#8217;t be! Yes; by Jove!
it <span class="nw">is&mdash;&mdash;</span>&rsquo;</p>

<p>He spoke some name I couldn&#8217;t catch, but Starlight
put a finger on his lips, and whispered:</p>

<p>&lsquo;You won&#8217;t tell, will you? Say you won&#8217;t.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The other nodded.</p>

<p>He smiled just like his old self.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Poor Aileen!&rsquo; he said, quite faint. His head fell
back. Starlight was dead!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Boldrewood&#8217;s characters, as he has said
himself, are constructed from many models.
And the Marstons are, it seems, the only
personages he has drawn solely from life.
Gardiner, with whom some readers have
<a name="png.221" id="png.221"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">217</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>identified Starlight, was, it is recorded,
&lsquo;a man of prepossessing appearance and
plausible address, who had many friends
even among the settlers never suspected
of sympathy with criminals, while many of
the fair sex regarded him as a veritable
hero.&rsquo;</p>

<p>That the romantic life of this noted
criminal furnished Boldrewood with some
material there cannot be any doubt, but the
fictitious bushranger is far from being in any
respect a mere copy of the real one. In
Starlight&#8217;s relations with women, for instance,
there is nothing but what is manly and
honourable, whereas one of Gardiner&#8217;s exploits
was the seduction of a settler&#8217;s wife,
a beautiful woman whom he induced to elope
with him to a remote district in Queensland.
And, further, none of the sensational incidents
connected with his capture&mdash;his escape
under a legal technicality from the death-penalty
suffered by some of his associates,
his imprisonment for twelve years and subsequent
exile&mdash;are made use of in the novel.</p>

<p>The narrative method adopted in <cite>Robbery
<a name="png.222" id="png.222"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">218</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>under Arms</cite> has so much contributed to the
success of the story as to be worthy of some
comparison with the ordinary style of the
author. The limitations imposed by the
choice of a narrator with no pretensions
to education or sentiment, and writing in
the first person, proved in this case salutary
rather than disadvantageous. They repressed
Boldrewood&#8217;s usual tendency to excessive
detail, and kept his attention closely fixed
on the drama of the story.</p>

<p>The occasional deficiency of local colour
and loss of effect in the grouping of the
characters is more than compensated for by
the racy piquancy of Dick Marston&#8217;s vernacular,
and the aspect, unrivalled in Australian
literature, which his account affords
of bushranging life from the bushranger&#8217;s
own point of view. In the truth with which
this view is presented lies the strength and
lasting merit of what might otherwise have
been little better than a commonplace series
of sensational episodes.</p>

<p>Starlight and the Marstons, as we see
them, are reckless and dangerous criminals,
<a name="png.223" id="png.223"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">219</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>but they are not exactly the &lsquo;bloodthirsty
cowards&rsquo; and &lsquo;murderers&rsquo; known to the
press and police of the period. The little
they can plead in excuse for their lives is
plainly stated, while no complaint is urged
against their fate, or attempt made to obscure
its obvious lesson. Grim old Ben Marston&#8217;s
career illustrates one of the results of the
stupidly cruel system of transporting persons
from England to the colonies for petty
offences which in these days are punished
by a slight fine, and his sons are types of
a class who were far from being as irreclaimable
as their offences made them appear.
&lsquo;Men like us,&rsquo; Dick Marston is once made
to say, &lsquo;are only half-and-half bad, like a
good many more in this world. They are
partly tempted into doing wrong by opportunity,
and kept back by circumstances from
getting into the straight track afterwards.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The examples given in the story of the
aptness of this remark are often very touching.
The poor Marston boys are indeed only
half bad. Their better natures, seconded by
the influence of a good mother and sister,
<a name="png.224" id="png.224"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">220</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>are continually urging them to reformation,
but for this there is no opportunity. The
decision of their fate by the turn of a coin
when the first great temptation comes is
symbolical of the trifling causes to which
the ruin of so many young Bushmen in the
early days of squatting was traceable.</p>

<p>The personal observation strongly marked
in all Boldrewood&#8217;s novels has in <cite>Robbery
under Arms</cite> its fullest, as well as most
skilful, expression. As a squatter, the author
had seen the practices of the cattle-thief, and
learned his language. He had observed the
extent to which idleness and a love of horseflesh
combined to fill the gaols of the country,
and in later years this knowledge was confirmed
in the course of his long experience
as a magistrate. The judgment with which
he presents the case of the young Marstons
as types of a class is excelled only by the
literary skill employed upon the character of
their chief.</p>

<p>But there was no need to make Dick
Marston so often emphasise the comfort of
living &lsquo;on the square,&rsquo; and the folly of ever
<a name="png.225" id="png.225"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">221</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>doing otherwise. The story bears a self-evident
moral. Humour there is in plenty,
but the pathos of tragedy is the dominant, as
it is the appropriate, tone of the book. In
no respect has greater accuracy been attained
than in the reproduction of the Australian
vernacular, that odd compound of English,
Irish, Scotch, and American phrases and
inflexions, with its slender admixture of
original terms. Visitors to Australia have
praised the purity of the English spoken
there by the middle classes. Mr. Froude,
as late as 1885, found that &lsquo;no provincialism
had yet developed itself,&rsquo; but he wrote chiefly
of what he had heard in the towns. It is in
the country that the colonial dialect&mdash;if speech
so largely imitative can yet be called a dialect&mdash;is
most heard.</p>

<p>Among other interesting features in Dick
Marston&#8217;s narrative is the curious half-impersonal
view which the outlaws take
of the efforts made by the Government to
capture them, and their strong dislike, on the
other hand, to the private persons who competed
with the police for the large rewards
<a name="png.226" id="png.226"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">222</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>offered. This detail is as true to life as the
example of the sympathy and assistance
accorded the bushrangers by settlers in the
neighbourhood of their mountain retreat.</p>

<p>It was sympathy of this kind, combined
with bribery, which so protected the Kelly
gang as to involve the Government of
Victoria in an outlay of about one hundred
and fifteen thousand pounds before their
destruction could be accomplished. Effective
literary use will be made at some time in the
future of the exploits of this last and most
daring of all the bushranging gangs, but
many years must elapse before the sordid
aspects of their career shall have been forgotten,
and only its romance be left. And
nothing short of genius will be required to
refine the rude proportions of Ned Kelly
into something like the gentlemanly exterior
of the dashing captain, the smooth gallant,
the humorist, philosopher, and quick-change
artist of <cite>Robbery under Arms</cite>.</p>

<p>In <cite>The Miner&#8217;s Right</cite>, which ranks second
in popularity among Boldrewood&#8217;s novels, the
personal narrative style is again adopted, but
<a name="png.227" id="png.227"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">223</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>with little effect of the kind produced by
Dick Marston&#8217;s vivid directness in the earlier
novel. Hereward Pole, the hero, is a
cultured Englishman, sensitive and sentimental,
who keeps an eye upon humanity at
large, as well as upon the business of making
a fortune which has brought him to the
colonies. Half of his record, though a
striking picture of the gold-fields, is not an
inherent part of the story of his own career.
Confined to their strictly just limits, the
events which combine to prolong his separation
from the sweetheart whom he has left in
England could have been told in fifty pages.
But this would not have been all the author
wished. He was satisfied with a slender
plot and a <i>dénouement</i> which can be guessed
almost from the outset as soon as he saw that
they would carry the glowing scenes and
episodes of diggings life with which his
memory was so richly stocked. One cannot
believe but that, in this case, his slender
attention to the long-drawn thread of the
story was the outcome of choice. Else where
was the need for elaborateness in such details
<a name="png.228" id="png.228"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">224</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>as the dispute over the Liberator claim at
Yatala, the trial of Pole and the inquest on
Challerson, with their rendering of witnesses&#8217;
depositions in the manner of a newspaper
report, the riot at Green Valley and Oxley,
and the scene at the funeral of the agitator
Radetsky? Yet, though these episodes are
given at great length, and do not form any
essential part of the story of Hereward Pole
and Ruth Allerton&mdash;the vindication of a
man&#8217;s honour and the triumph of a woman&#8217;s
invincible devotion&mdash;they are told with so
much intimate knowledge and strength of
colouring as almost to supply the absence of
a plot, and to make the story, apart from
artistic considerations, a really fine piece
of work.</p>

<p>It has a popularity in the English libraries
which is itself a proof of the service done by
the author to those who would know something
of the careers of varying success and
bitter failure, of hardship and romantic
adventure, upon which so many of their
kinsmen set out forty years ago. <cite>Nevermore</cite>
and <cite>The Sphinx of Eaglehawk</cite> give other
<a name="png.229" id="png.229"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">225</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>views of the gold-digging days, chiefly of
their seamy side, but these stories offer
nothing that equals in interest the splendid
panorama of pioneer life revealed in <cite>The
Miner&#8217;s Right</cite>.</p>

<p>Boldrewood has more than once insisted
with evident pleasure upon the general good
behaviour and manliness of the miners, and,
having been one of those all-seeing autocrats,
the gold-fields commissioners, he is an authority
to be believed on the subject. In <cite>Robbery
under Arms</cite> the names are given of thirty
races represented on the Turon field, and
Hereward Pole, recounting his early impressions
of Yatala, says: &lsquo;I was never done
wondering of what struck me as the chief
characteristic of this great army of adventurers
suddenly gathered together from all
seas and lands, namely, its outward propriety
and submission to the law.&rsquo; Elsewhere he
likens the sensible reticence which they observed
respecting their own affairs and those
of their neighbours to the demeanour and
mode of thought which prevails in club life.</p>

<p>A passage from Dick Marston&#8217;s account
<a name="png.230" id="png.230"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">226</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>of what he saw at Turon is worth reproducing
here as characteristic of the author&#8217;s representation
of a gold-fields community and as
a sample of his humour. The &lsquo;three
honourables,&rsquo; of whom the disguised bushranger
captain is one, are together in a
hotel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;The last time I drank wine as good as this,&rsquo; says
Starlight, &lsquo;was at the Caffy Troy, something or other, in
Paris. I wouldn&#8217;t mind being there again, with the
Variety Opera to follow&mdash;would you, Clifford?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, I don&#8217;t know,&rsquo; says the other swell. &lsquo;I find this
amazing good fun for a bit. I never was in such grand
condition since I left Oxford. This eight hours&#8217; shift
business is just the right thing for training. I feel fit to
go for a man&#8217;s life. Just feel this, Despard,&rsquo; and he
holds out his arm to the camp swell. &lsquo;There&#8217;s muscle
for you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Plenty of muscle,&rsquo; says Mr. Despard, looking round.
He was a swell that didn&#8217;t work, and wouldn&#8217;t work, and
thought it fine to treat the diggers like dogs&hellip;. &lsquo;Plenty
of muscle,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;but devilish little society.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I don&#8217;t agree with you,&rsquo; says the other honourable.
&lsquo;It&#8217;s the most amusing, and, in a way, instructive place
for a man who wants to know his fellow-creatures I was
ever in. I never pass a day without meeting some fresh
variety of the human race, man or woman; and their
experiences are well worth knowing, I can tell you. Not
that they&#8217;re in a hurry to impart them; for that there&#8217;s
<a name="png.231" id="png.231"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">227</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>more natural unaffected good manners on a digging than
in any society I ever mingled in I shall never doubt.
But when they see you don&#8217;t want to patronise, and are
content to be as simple man among men, there&#8217;s nothing
they won&#8217;t do for you or tell you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, <span class="nw">d&mdash;&mdash;n</span> one&#8217;s fellow-creatures! present company
excepted,&rsquo; says Mr. Despard, filling his glass, &lsquo;and the
man that grew this &ldquo;tipple.&rdquo; They&#8217;re useful to me now
and then, and one has to put up with this crowd; but I
never could take much interest in them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;All the worse for you, Despard,&rsquo; says Clifford:
&lsquo;you&#8217;re wasting your chances&mdash;golden opportunities in
every sense of the word. You&#8217;ll never see such a spectacle
as this, perhaps, again as long as you live. It&#8217;s a fancy-dress
ball with real characters.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Dashed bad characters, if we only knew,&rsquo; says Despard,
yawning. &lsquo;What do you say, Haughton?&rsquo; looking
at Starlight, who was playing with his glass, and not
listening much, by the look of him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In his latest novels Boldrewood reverts to
his familiar themes. <cite>The Sphinx of Eaglehawk</cite>,
the shortest of all his works, might
have been an excerpt from The <cite>Miner&#8217;s
Right</cite>; and the scene of <cite>The Crooked Stick</cite>
is an inland station in New South Wales in
the days of bushranging and disastrous
droughts.</p>

<p>The materials employed in the latter story
reproduce the principal features of almost a
<a name="png.232" id="png.232"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">228</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>score of other Australian novels published
within the last few years. The love-affairs
of a beautiful, impulsive girl, sighing for
knowledge of the great world beyond the
limits of her narrow experience; the influence
upon her of a fascinating and gentlemanly
Englishman, with aristocratic connections
and a dubious past; the manly young
Australian, whose loyalty, undervalued for a
time, is rewarded in the end&mdash;these are some
of the items which go to the making of a
class of story already somewhat too common.
The fact that Boldrewood continues to make
such subjects interesting is due largely to the
pervading sense of scrupulous truth, the evident
element of personal experience, and the
general cheerfulness of tone, which are never
absent from any product of his pen, and
which constitute his highest claims to rank in
Australian literature.</p>

 class="pgmark">229</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>MRS. CAMPBELL PRAED.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">To</span> Mrs. Campbell Praed belongs the credit
of being the first to attempt to give an extended
and impartial view of the social and
political life of the upper classes in Australia.
While she has not ignored whatever seemed
picturesque in the external aspects of the
country, her chief concern has been with the
people themselves. Some of the best of her
works&mdash;<cite>Policy and Passion</cite> and <cite>Miss Jacobsen&#8217;s
Chance</cite>, for example&mdash;might fairly be
named as an answer to the somewhat common
complaint of a deficiency of dramatic suggestion
in colonial life.</p>

<p>In a preface to the first-named novel, Mrs.
Praed explains it to have been her wish to
depict &lsquo;certain phases of Australian life, in
which the main interests and dominant
<a name="png.234" id="png.234"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">230</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>passions of the personages concerned are
identical with those which might readily
present themselves upon a European stage,
but which directly and indirectly are influenced
by striking natural surroundings and
conditions of being inseparable from the
youth of a vigorous and impulsive nation.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The point of view here taken by the
author at almost the beginning of her literary
career has been maintained in most cases
throughout her later work. The same
preface might almost, in fact, serve for all
her Australian stories. They describe
broadly, in an attitude of good-natured criticism,
the leading facts in the intellectual life
of the people; their proud self-reliance,
tempered by an acute sense of isolation and
its disadvantages; their susceptibility to
foreign criticism and example; their frank,
natural manners in social customs of native
origin, contrasted with their quaintly-rigid
observance of conventionalities which have
long since been relaxed in the mother
country whence they were copied.</p>

<p>Mrs. Praed has turned to account more
<a name="png.235" id="png.235"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">231</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>fully than any other writer the little affectations
of that small upper crust of Antipodean
society which is sufficiently cultured to have
developed a taste for aristocratic European
habits, along with an uncomfortable suspicion
of &lsquo;bad form&rsquo; in anything of purely local
growth. This is the class which maintains
an air of portentous solemnity in public
ceremonials, and is liable at any moment to
be convulsed by a question of precedence at
a Government House dinner.</p>

<p>From a lively appreciation of comedy to
caricature is an easy descent which the author
has not always resisted, but her exaggeration
is so obviously resorted to in the interests of
fun that it is unlikely to mislead. There is
certainly no need to repudiate as untypical of
Australian political society the Pickwickian
spectacle of a drunken Postmaster-General
fearfully trying to walk a plank after a Vice-regal
dinner, in order to win three dozen
of champagne wagered by the leader of the
Opposition, while the Premier looks on and
holds his sides with merriment; or the case
of the Premier&#8217;s wife, who, on being told by
<a name="png.236" id="png.236"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">232</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>a newly-arrived Governor&mdash;a musical enthusiast&mdash;that
he hoped to be able to &lsquo;introduce
Wagner&rsquo; at the local philharmonic concerts,
said: &lsquo;I&#8217;m sure we shall be very pleased to
see the gentleman.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Considering, however, the opportunities
which colonial life, and especially colonial
politics, afford for ridicule, the author has
been commendably careful to avoid, as far as
possible, giving real offence. Yet her criticism
is sufficiently free to be piquant, and, on
the whole, as salutary as it is entertaining.
&lsquo;Why need Australians always be on the
defensive?&rsquo; asks more than once an Englishman
in one of her novels. The author seems
to have put the same question to herself as
an Australian, and to have decided that ultra-sensitiveness
is a worse vice than affectation,
and that her compatriots, by giving way to
it, do both themselves and their country an
injustice. For it implies a too low estimate
of what is fresh and strong and of real merit
in the independent life of the nation.</p>

<p>Colonists need a little more of the philosophic
and common-sense spirit which can
<a name="png.237" id="png.237"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">233</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>look upon deficiencies and crudities merely
as phases in the natural evolution of society
in a new land. This is what Mrs. Praed has
endeavoured to teach in some of her stories.
The lesson is often surrounded with a good
deal of bantering discussion; it may not
always be apparent to an English reader,
but it can hardly be overlooked by an Australian.
There is rarely anything so pointed
as the conversation between Miss Jacobsen
and her lover, Chepstowe. The former has
been wondering what the cultivated Englishman
thought of a recent noisy and rather
vulgar reception tendered to a new Governor
for whom he is acting as private secretary.
Chepstowe is suspected of being secretly
amused at his surroundings. But his view
of them is purely rational and matter-of-fact.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;You know, I fancy you colonists think rather too
little of yourselves, and we in England rather too much.
Or I&#8217;ll put it in another way. I fancy you colonists
think too much about yourselves, and we in England
think too little.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You said just now that you think too much.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes; it&#8217;s the same thing put in a different way. We
<a name="png.238" id="png.238"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">234</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>think too much of ourselves, and for that reason too
little about ourselves. You are always thinking somebody
is laughing at you; we have made up our minds
that we are the admiration of everybody. We are often
very ridiculous, and don&#8217;t know it. You often think you
are ridiculous when you really are not.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I think we must have seemed very ridiculous the day
you landed&hellip;. I know you are astonished at some of
our public men&hellip;. You will write home and say how
rude and rough and vulgar some of them are.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If one wants to see the ridiculous, one can see it
everywhere. We have some public men at home who
are rude and rough, and vulgar and ridiculous&hellip;.
One has to make allowances, of course, for training and
habits, and all that&hellip;. When our fellows are rough,
there is less excuse for them. The more one goes about
the world, the less one sees to laugh at, I think&hellip;.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>English self-complacency is, of course, a
growth of centuries, but perhaps a deliberate
and intelligent effort to acquire some of it in
Australia would be the best specific for that
consciousness which, colonists should not
forget, is the mark of insignificance. It has
been said that Australians already have too
much to say for themselves and their country.
The assertion is only applicable to a small
boisterous class who have never seen anything
beyond their own shores.</p>

<p><a name="png.239" id="png.239"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">235</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>A much commoner element of Antipodean
life, one which some of Mrs. Praed&#8217;s characters
notably illustrate, is the desire for
wider experience and culture produced among
educated people by their constant use of
British and European literature. James Ferguson,
the young squatter in <cite>The Head
Station</cite>, represents those Australians who,
though stout believers in their own country,
feel its intellectual deficiencies&mdash;perhaps too
much; who are more English than the
English themselves in their veneration for
the historic associations of the mother land;
who, when they go to London, are curiously
at home in streets and among sights that
have been more or less definitely outlined in
their imagination from early childhood.</p>

<p>While three of his English-bred companions
are exchanging reminiscences of
London life, Ferguson listens with an eager
interest, &lsquo;putting in a remark every now and
then which had the savour, so readily detected,
of acquaintance with the thing in
question by means of books rather than personal
experience.&rsquo; In Mrs. Praed&#8217;s stories,
<a name="png.240" id="png.240"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">236</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>as in real life, a personal acquaintance with
other countries gives the Australian a truer
appreciation of the good in his own. The
man who has taken part in the artificialities
of a London season, or has been a spectator
of its petty rivalries, returns joyfully to a
simpler life; the woman who is prone to
deify the smooth-spoken Englishman, learns
through him to value the more homely virtues
of colonial manhood.</p>

<p>In the difficult task of rendering attractive
the restricted life of the squatting class, who
form the country aristocracy of Australia,
Mrs. Praed has combined humour and a terse
cultivated style of expression with a dramatic
sense, which has guided her past details that
are merely commonplace. The natural surroundings
of a head station furnish materials
for bright little sketches immediately associated
with some romantic episode in the
story; there is no vague straining to create
&lsquo;atmosphere,&rsquo; or anything that a judicious
reader would skip.</p>

<p>The beautiful Honoria Longleat reclining in
a hammock under the vine-trellised verandah
<a name="png.241" id="png.241"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">237</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>at Kooralbyn, stray shafts of sunlight imparting
a warm chestnut tint to her hair, a trailing
withe of orange begonia touching her
shoulder, a book in her lap and a bundle of
guavas on the ground beside her; Elsie
Valliant waiting for her lover on the rocky
crossing of Luya Dell, framed between two
giant cedars and outlined cameo-like against
the blue sky; Gretta Reay, the proud, sturdy
little belle of Doondi, with upturned sleeves
at her churn, pretending unconcern when she
is surprised by her English visitors&mdash;these
are some of the pictures in which the author
commemorates much that is noteworthy in
the warmth and colour of tropical Australia
and in the daily life of its inhabitants. This
fondness for posing her heroines is one of
the minor features of her work. Its results
in some of her later novels are not, however,
always agreeable: a few of the scenes in the
history of the unhappy Judith Fountain in
<cite>Affinities</cite> are painful, and the portrait, in <cite>The
Brother of the Shadow</cite>, of Mrs. Vascher as
she lies in the mesmerist&#8217;s blue-silk-lined
room is an unnecessary ghastly elaboration.</p>

<p><a name="png.242" id="png.242"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">238</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>The hardships suggested by the beginnings
of pastoral life amid the giant forests and
intense loneliness of Australia are never
allowed by Mrs. Praed to give a gloomy
colour to her stories. It is one of their distinct
merits that they present the humorous
incongruities rather than the trials of pioneering,
though the latter are by no means
ignored. In the first three chapters of <cite>The
Romance of a Station</cite> some excellent humour
is provided by the young bride&#8217;s account of
her home-coming to the rude mansion on her
husbands mosquito-infested island station,
and the ludicrous privations she encountered
there. There is nothing of the kind more
amusing in the whole of Australian fiction.
The description of the household pets, and
the vermin&mdash;including a lizard with an uncanny
habit of &lsquo;unfastening its tail and making
off on its stump when pursued&rsquo;&mdash;rivals the
famous verandah scene in <cite>Geoffry Hamlyn</cite>.
An intimation in the preface that these
experiences are a faithful record from the
early life of the author herself sufficiently
explains their graphic quality. Amusing also
<a name="png.243" id="png.243"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">239</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>are the sketches of the aristocratic settlers in
<cite>Policy and Passion</cite> and <cite>Outlaw and Lawmaker</cite>
who try to apply the principles of
æstheticism to the crude surroundings of
their new-made homes in the backwoods&mdash;Dolph
Bassett with his ornamental bridges
and rockeries and his grand piano; Lord
Horace Gage explaining with his maxim, &lsquo;If
we can&#8217;t be comfortable, let us at least be
artistic,&rsquo; a neglect to fill up the chinks in his
slab hut.</p>

<p>Queensland, the scene of Mrs. Praed&#8217;s
colonial experience and the &lsquo;Leichardt&#8217;s
Land&rsquo; of her stories, differs notably from the
rest of Australia only in climate; its social
and political conditions are essentially the
same in character as those in the rest of the
country. The Englishman acquiring colonial
experience, the squatter living in various
stages of comfort or discomfort, the gentleman
spendthrift from whom his family has
parted with the affectionate injunction, &lsquo;God
bless you, dear boy; let us never see your
face again!&rsquo; and the political parties which
go in and out of office &lsquo;like buckets in a
<a name="png.244" id="png.244"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">240</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>well&rsquo; (to use the author&#8217;s own expression),
are, or have been, common features of every
colony. Like several of her heroines, Mrs.
Praed alternated life in the country with the
gaieties of the capital.</p>

<p>The position of her father, the Hon. T. L.
Murray-Prior, as a member of the Legislative
Council, brought her into contact with those
political and vice-regal circles of which she
has given entertaining and occasionally
derisive accounts in <cite>Policy and Passion</cite>,
<cite>Miss Jacobsen&#8217;s Chance</cite>, and elsewhere. Her
description in the former story of the wealthy
landowners, who adopt a passive and somewhat
disdainful attitude towards party strife,
applies to a class already large in the colonies.
Whether such an attitude is consistent with
&lsquo;the truest conservatism to be found in Australia,&rsquo;
which they are said to represent, may
be questioned. It seems rather to indicate
selfishness, petulance, and lack of patriotism.</p>

<p>It is not, however, upon the business of
politics or the humours and makeshifts of
colonial life that Mrs. Praed has expended
her best efforts as a writer. Some study of
<a name="png.245" id="png.245"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">241</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the human emotions is the primary interest
in all her novels. There is nearly always
love of the passionate and romantic kind,
prompted on the one side by impulse,
ignorance or glamour, and on the other by
passing fancy or self-interest: the love of an
innocent, unsophisticated woman for a man
experienced in the pleasures and some of
the darker vices of life; and, in contrast, the
blunt respect and devotion of the typical
Australian man for the same woman, and her
light estimate of his worth. The tragedies
of marriage&mdash;the union of the refined and
imaginative with the coarse and commonplace,
the high-souled with the worldly and
cynical, the pure with the impure&mdash;are
correlative themes of some of the strongest
of the novels. In these, pathos is the prevailing
tone. We have the spectacle of the
woman&#8217;s blind, illogical trust abused, her
helplessness in self-inflicted misery, or the
tenacity with which, in temptation, she clings
to the safeguards of conventional morality.
In most cases this tenacity, which the author
accounts an instinct rather than a virtue, is
<a name="png.246" id="png.246"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">242</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>either allowed to triumph, or is placed by
death beyond the possibility of a supreme
test. In the loves of Hester Murgatroyd
and Durnford in <cite>The Head Station</cite>, of Mrs.
Lomax and Leopold D&#8217;Acosta in <cite>The Bond
of Wedlock</cite>, and of Mrs. Borlase and Esmé
Colquhoun in <cite>Affinities</cite>, it is the woman who
directly, or by implication, insists upon
respect of the marriage tie so long as it
remains a legal obligation.</p>

<p>But it should be made clear that Mrs.
Praed is not in any sense a propagandist on
the subject of marriage. She illustrates,
often impressively, its difficulties and anomalies,
but leaves the rest to the judgment of
the reader. The romantic, ignorant girl who
marries on trust, or is ready to do so, has
numerous representatives in these novels.
Though it is a woman&#8217;s view of her trials
and unhappiness that is given, there is
nothing in the shape of a crusade against
male vices. It is not the faults of men that
are dwelt upon so much as the inevitably
lenient, the pitifully inadequate estimate
which women make of men themselves.</p>

<p><a name="png.247" id="png.247"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">243</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>The most striking illustration of this
feature is probably contained in the last
scenes of <cite>The Bond of Wedlock</cite>, where the
heroine learns at once the hypocrisy of her
father and the dishonour of her lover. The
father, in a fit of resentment, has revealed the
mean plot by which she has been enabled to
divorce her husband and marry Sir Leopold
D&#8217;Acosta. The latter, seeing that Mrs.
Lomax would never consent to an elopement,
has paid another woman&mdash;a former mistress
of his&mdash;to incriminate Harvey Lomax, while
the audacious old humbug, his father-in-law,
does the business of a detective. Ariana&#8217;s
dream of happiness is dissipated. She
hardens into indifference. The revelation
completes the disillusionment which had
already begun. &lsquo;I had set you up as my
hero, and my ideal, and I have found you&mdash;a
man.&rsquo; This is the summary of her life&#8217;s
experience, which in effect is also that of
Esther Hagart, Ginevra Rolt, Christina
Chard, Ina Gage, and others in the list of
Mrs. Praed&#8217;s unhappy heroines. Married
life, as they illustrate it, is usually a
<a name="png.248" id="png.248"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">244</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>compromise. Even that of Mrs. Lomax is not
quite a failure. Her husband does not
attempt to conceal the fact that she no longer
interests him, but with that commonly-accepted
philosophy which recognises a wife
as at least an adjunct to conventional respectability,
he reminds her that, after all,
their union has some advantages:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;I would much rather have you for a wife than any
other woman I ever knew; and if I sometimes think a
man is better who hasn&#8217;t a wife, it is only when you are
in one of those reproachful moods, and seem as if you
were anxious to make me out a heartless sort of miscreant.
In Heaven&#8217;s name, why not make the best of
things? Why need we be melodramatic? We are man
and woman of the world. We must take the world as we
find it, and ourselves for what it has made us.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ariana&#8217;s answer was given later on when
she realized the full extent to which she had
been self-deluded: &lsquo;I am not going to be
melodramatic. We can be very good friends
on the outside. We need never be anything
more.&rsquo;</p>

<p>A strong bias towards analysis is the chief
characteristic of Mrs. Praed&#8217;s studies in
<a name="png.249" id="png.249"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">245</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>character. As in her illustrations of the perplexing
uncertainties of married life it is the
woman&#8217;s point of view that is most impressively
presented, so in each story there is at
least one woman whose personality stands
out in pathetic relief and claims paramount
attention. She is usually a cultivated woman
of romantic tendency, living in a restricted
social environment, and displaying the craving
of that class of her sex for change, pleasurable
excitement, and sympathy. In the
satisfaction of her yearnings or ambitions
are seen, perhaps more often than is typical,
the gloomy aspects of marriage, and the incompetence
of women to manage their own
lives.</p>

<p>The average Australian girl of real life is
neither very romantic nor fastidious. She is
cheerful, adaptable, too fond of pleasure to
be thoughtful, and has a decided inclination
towards married life. Its material advantages
and status attract her&mdash;and, for the rest, she
has a vague confidence that everything will
come right. Nowhere is the horror of elderly
spinsterhood more potent.  The influence of
<a name="png.250" id="png.250"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">246</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>independent professional life fostered by the
large public schools is still infinitesimal.</p>

<p>The type upon which Mrs. Praed has
bestowed her most elaborate work belongs to
a class both higher and far fewer in numbers.
It is the class that Mr. Froude had chiefly in
view when he noted the absence of &lsquo;severe
intellectual interests&rsquo; as a deficiency of
society at Sydney.</p>

<p>Honoria Longleat, the principal study of
Mrs. Praed&#8217;s second novel, may, with a few
obvious deductions, be taken as a fair example
of the colonial woman educated beyond sympathy
with her native surroundings, and unprovided
with any employment for her mental
energies. With the distractions and interests
of her narrow circle exhausted, and the knowledge
that her future&mdash;her only possible future&mdash;must
soon be decided by marriage, she is
consumed with an intense and reckless desire
for new emotional experience. Her unrest
is like that of the large class of American
women who are educated above the purely
commercial standard of their fathers and
brothers, and are impelled to satisfy their
<a name="png.251" id="png.251"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">247</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>intellectual cravings by frequent European
travel.</p>

<p>&lsquo;This is only a state of half-existence,&rsquo;
said Honoria in reference to her country life
in Australia. &lsquo;Books are so unsatisfying! I
read them greedily at first, then throw them
aside in disgust. They never take one below
the surface&hellip;. I want to grow and live&hellip;.
What is the use of living unless one can
gauge one&#8217;s capacity for sensation?&rsquo; Gretta
Reay, in whom the same discontent is reproduced,
exclaims: &lsquo;Ah, we Australians are
like birds shut up in a large cage&mdash;our lives
are little and narrow, for all that our home is
so big.&rsquo;</p>

<p>By these and other characters of the same
type, the cultivated Englishman, who offers
them the prospect of change and emancipation
from monotony, is distinctly preferred in
marriage to the man of colonial birth and
experience. &lsquo;Don&#8217;t you know,&rsquo; says Gretta
to one of the latter, &lsquo;that an Australian girl&#8217;s
first aim is to captivate an Englishman of rank
and be translated to a higher sphere&mdash;failing
that, to make the best of a rich squatter?&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.252" id="png.252"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">248</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>The heroine of <cite>Outlaw and Lawmaker</cite>
differs from Gretta only in being more
emphatic in her preference for the doubtful
stranger, and irrational in her objections to
her tried Australian lover, Frank Hallett.
Once, in a riding-party, &lsquo;she had moodily
watched his (Hallett&#8217;s) square, determined
bushman&#8217;s back as he jogged along in front
of her, and compared it with Blake&#8217;s easy,
graceful, rather rakish, bearing. Why was
Frank so stolid, so good, so commonplace?&rsquo;</p>

<p>A trifling superficial defect of the same
sort turns the tables against the gallant young
explorer, Dyson Maddox, in his first suit for
the hand of Miss Longleat. The half-dozen
analytical studies of female character in the
principal novels of Mrs. Praed are far from
flattering to her countrywomen, and might be
somewhat misleading if we permitted ourselves
to forget that in every case it is only
one phase of a colonial girl&#8217;s life that is being
given.</p>

<p>The whims, the countless flirtations, the
greed for new sensations, the inconsistencies
and the apparent mercenary attitude towards
<a name="png.253" id="png.253"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">249</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>marriage, are not more permanently characteristic
of the women of Australia than of
Englishwomen with equal opportunities. The
impulses of the former are under few conventional
restraints; they have a greater control
of their lives: that is the only material difference.
The matrimonial creed of Gretta
Reay expresses rather the exaggerated
cynicism of a coquette than a fact generally
true of the class to which she belongs. The
experiences of herself and of other leading
characters in these stories correctly show
that, although Australian women have an
undoubted preference for the gentlemanly
product of an older civilisation, it is a preference
of sentiment in which self-interest
and prudence are scarcely considered.</p>

<p>Even Weeta Wilson, the professional
beauty so strikingly portrayed in <cite>The
Romance of a Station</cite>, has a soul above her
own avowed commercial view of marriage.
It had been systematically planned that she
should contract an aristocratic alliance; for
years she had co-operated with her parents
in elaborate preparations, half pathetic, half
<a name="png.254" id="png.254"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">250</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>ludicrous; she had been guarded and nurtured
like a hothouse-plant. At last, when
her opportunity came, she relinquished her
lover on finding that there was another who
had a prior right to him.</p>

<p>The subtle skill with which some of the
nobler qualities of her women are brought
out, especially their capacity for self-sacrifice
and devotion, marks Mrs. Praed&#8217;s highest
point of achievement in the portrayal of
character. Her knowledge of the mental
complexities of her own sex is both deeper
and better expressed than her observation of
men. In the most inconsistent, the most
cynical, or the shallowest of her women, there
is a latent tenderness, a soft womanliness,
which conquers dislike. Thus, it is impossible
to lack sympathy for Christina Chard, or
accept her own estimate of her selfishness,
after reading the finely-written scene in which
she is found kneeling by the bedside of
her dying child, from whom she has been so
cruelly separated, while her recreant husband
stands apart in awe and humiliation; or,
again, in the interview with Frederica
<a name="png.255" id="png.255"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">251</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Barnadine, when the claims of both women to
the love of Rolf Luard are discussed.</p>

<p>The absence of similar redeeming qualities
in several of the principal male characters
leaves them almost wholly without definite
claim on our regard, and also lessens the
effect of the author&#8217;s frequent endeavours
to impartially contrast the unconsciously low
moral standard of the average worldly man&mdash;the
standard which society accepts&mdash;with
the high, impracticable ideals of inexperienced
womanhood.</p>

<p>The heroines in nearly all of Mrs. Praed&#8217;s
stories have the life of sentiment and passion
revealed to them by men older in years,
and skilled in those small arts and graces
of refined society which are ever attractive
to women. But, in fulfilling this design, the
men themselves are often placed in a strained
and artificial pose. The presentation of the
purely emotional side of their nature inevitably
tends to produce an appearance of weakness
and effeminacy.</p>

<p>There is hardly a single admirable quality
in Barrington, the base lover of Honoria
<a name="png.256" id="png.256"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">252</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Longleat; or in George Brand, who deserts
Esther Hagart in her poverty and loneliness,
and years afterwards, on finding her recognised
as the niece of an English baronet,
persuades her into an unhappy marriage; or
in Brian Gilmore, the profligate in <cite>Moloch</cite>,
who seeks to rejuvenate his jaded passions
with the love of an innocent girl, after abandoning
another woman whose life he has
spoiled. Sir Bruce Carr-Gambier forsakes
Christina Chard and her child for cowardly
reasons similar to those pleaded by Brand.
When they meet, long-after, he offers his
devotion again, but only because her developed
beauty, position, and reputed wealth
attract him.</p>

<p>It is true that these characters fairly fulfil
the author&#8217;s intention, so far as they bring
into vivid juxtaposition the polished life of
the old world with the simplicity of the new,
and help to give the necessary dramatic
point to the several stories; but there is so
much of the cad in their nature and conduct,
that it is difficult to accept them as representatives
of any conceivable type of the
<a name="png.257" id="png.257"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">253</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Englishman of birth and refinement. This
result, however, does not imply any actual
inability on the part of the author to realise
the standard of true manhood in all its varying
strength and foibles, its tenderness and
honour. Where there has not seemed any
necessity to bend the character to the requirements
of the story, admirably life-like
sketches of men have been produced&mdash;such
as Rolf Luard in <cite>Christina Chard</cite> and
Bernard Comyn in <cite>An Australian Heroine</cite>
among Englishmen; and Dyson Maddox,
Frank Hallett, and James Ferguson among
Australians.</p>

<p>Though it is plain that Mrs. Praed has
generally found colonial men wanting in interest
in proportion as they themselves lack
the polish that travel and extended experience
of social life impart, she has not overlooked
the rugged dignity, the truth and
virility, which are their highest characteristics.
Alluding to Ferguson as one type
of his country, she observes that, &lsquo;underlying
the rough-and-ready manners and the
prosaic routine of bush-life, there is an
<a name="png.258" id="png.258"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">254</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>old-world chivalry, a reverence for women, a
purity of thought, a delicacy of sentiment&hellip;.
This is partly due to the breezy moral
atmosphere, and partly to the influence of
books, which become living realities in the
solitude and monotony of existence among
the gum-trees. The typical Australian is
an odd combination of the practical and the
ideal. He is a student who learns to read
to himself a foreign language, but does not
attain to its pronunciation. He has no
knowledge of the current jargon or society
slang. He has unconsciously rejected vulgarisms
and shallow conceits; but all the deeper
thoughts, the poetry of life, which appeal to
the soul, he has made his own.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Ferguson himself echoes the same estimate
in pleading his suit with Miss Reay. &lsquo;It
seems to me,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;that there&#8217;s a kind
of chivalry which can be practised in the
bush here better than in great cities&mdash;the
chivalry Tennyson writes about&mdash;the knighthood
that isn&#8217;t earned by sauntering through
life in a graceful, smiling sort of way, with
your heart in your hand, but in simplicity
<a name="png.259" id="png.259"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">255</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>and faith; by love of one woman, and reverence
of all women for her sake.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Compared with the fascinating aristocrats
and adventurers, the Australian man seems
crudely provincial. Yet he is never shown
in an incorrect or merely satirical light.
There are, to be sure, occasions when he
appears too tame and Dobbin-like in acceptance
of his lady&#8217;s caprices; but this is partly
an evidence of that mixture of stiff native
pride and independence which forbids servile
appeal even to one he loves.</p>

<p>The deficiency of which the reader is most
often conscious in endeavouring to make a
general estimate of Mrs. Praed&#8217;s work is a
want of breadth in her scope&mdash;a presentation
too constant and too tense of certain phases
of the passionate life of men and women, to
the comparative exclusion of those softer and
higher attributes which even Charlotte Brontë
(whose touch that of Mrs. Praed occasionally
resembles) did not neglect. In other words,
we are not given enough to admire. There
are few pictures&mdash;and none that can be called
memorable&mdash;of happy married life to contrast
<a name="png.260" id="png.260"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">256</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>with the vivid tragedies of mistaken unions.
An inclination towards humorous disdain
characterizes the references in the stories
to conjugal relations of the ordinarily satisfactory
kind. And when those of a filial
nature are brought into prominence, they, too,
often have only a pathetic or painful aspect&mdash;love
on the one side repelled by indifference;
an uncouth parent offering rough sympathy
that irritates instead of soothes; a
sensitive girl writhing under the brutalities
or <i>gaucheries</i> of a drunken father.</p>

<p>A survey of the author&#8217;s female characters
will recall over a score of names of discontented
girls experimenting in life&mdash;flirts,
minxes, unhappy wives, and shallow society
women; while after passing over half a dozen
of the <i>ingénue</i>, the amusing and the neutral
types, there remain only about four to represent
the highest and most lovable qualities
of womanhood. A similar division might be
made between the male characters, though
here the preponderance of the bad would
not be so great as in the first case.</p>

<p>The descriptions of English society which
<a name="png.261" id="png.261"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">257</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>are amongst Mrs. Praed&#8217;s best work are
marked by the same clear vision of the
darker side of human nature that is displayed
in the treatment of English character in her
Australian novels. Her view of the &lsquo;smart&rsquo;
section of English society is somewhat severe.
After reading several of her novels, one could
almost imagine her defending her literary
preference in the words of Esmé Colquhoun,
in <cite>Affinities</cite>: &lsquo;What is our mission&mdash;we
writers&mdash;but to distil the essence of the age?
The critics tell us that we are complex, that
we are corrupt, that we are anatomists of
diseased minds. We reply: The age is
complex; the age is corrupt, and the society
we depict is the outcome of influences which
have been gathering through centuries of
advancing civilization &hellip; the reign of healthy
melodrama is over; the reign of analysis has
commenced. We make dramas of our sensations,
not of our actions.&rsquo; The same view
is expressed in an article contributed by Mrs.
Praed to the <cite>North American Review</cite> in
1890. &lsquo;Analysis, not action,&rsquo; she notes as
the prevailing characteristic of the fiction
<a name="png.262" id="png.262"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">258</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>produced by female writers, &lsquo;as it is also of
our modern social life.&rsquo; But, &lsquo;to dissect
human nature under its society swathings
needs,&rsquo; she adds, &lsquo;the skill of a Balzac or a
Thackeray, while the feminine counterpart of
a Balzac or a Thackeray is difficult to find.&rsquo;</p>

<p>That indefinable power which includes
sympathetic insight and does not overlook
whatever is good even in the most repulsive
character is, perhaps, what the describers in
fiction of modern society need even more
than skill in dissection. To observe and
dissect what is corrupt is easier than to make
the record of corruption presentable. Mrs.
Praed&#8217;s own tale <cite>The Bond of Wedlock</cite>, with
all its undoubted cleverness, its realism and
dramatic strength, fails in its due impression
as a picture of latter-day English morals
because it is too sordid, too completely devoid
of any of the better qualities of humanity.</p>

<p>To see Mrs. Praed in her most agreeable
and natural moods one must revert to the
novels in which the scenery and people of
her own country are described. In <cite>Miss
Jacobsen&#8217;s Chance</cite> we have her liveliest
<a name="png.263" id="png.263"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">259</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>example of humour and caricature, in <cite>The
Head Station</cite> her most cheerful pictures of
country life, and in <cite>Christina Chard</cite> some
account of the society with which colonists of
wealth surround themselves in London. The
latter story has several finely dramatic scenes
and is a sample of the author&#8217;s mature work.
Hers is the most comprehensive view that
we have of the social and political life of the
Antipodes, and for this and for her minutely
recorded knowledge of her own sex she will
long continue to hold and deserve a foremost
place in Australian literature.</p>




<h2><a name="png.264" id="png.264"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">260</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>TASMA.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Between</span> the writers who profess not to
see anything individual in the life of Australia
and those others who confine themselves
to describing a few of its principal
scenes and types of character, Tasma holds a
middle and independent place. She is absolutely
without predilections and hobbies. Her
materials are chosen for some quality of
picturesqueness rather than for the purpose
of illustrating any phase of life at the Antipodes
or elsewhere. So little are some of
her novels concerned with the external appearances
of the country that the scene of
their action might easily be transferred to
almost any part of Great Britain or America.</p>

<p>Incidentally she has given a few strongly-sketched
views of places&mdash;of Melbourne in
<a name="png.265" id="png.265"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">261</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>midsummer, with its buildings of sombre
bluestone and stucco, and streets swept by
dust-laden hot winds; of Riverina, arid and
drought-stricken; and of the peaceful beauty
of rural Tasmania, the home of her own
youth&mdash;but these and other descriptions from
the same pen are slight compared with
similar work in the stories of Kingsley,
Boldrewood, and Mrs. Campbell Praed.</p>

<p>Tasma, as one of the younger writers, has
rightly seen that, for the present at all events,
more than sufficient use has been made in
fiction of the natural peculiarities of Australia.
Her novels are, moreover, all character
studies, and little dependent upon local
colour for their interest. Her quiet, satirical
humour and power of rapidly and mordantly
sketching a portrait, do much to justify a
comparison which her friends sometimes
make of her writings with those of George
Eliot and Jane Austen. Rolf Boldrewood,
after the publication of her first three books,
hailed her as the &lsquo;Australian George Eliot,&rsquo;
and the title is certainly more fitting than the
praise implied by the other comparison. She
<a name="png.266" id="png.266"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">262</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>has much of George Eliot&#8217;s conscientious
literary expression, direct masculine way of
looking at life, and unsparing criticism of
her own sex. While reminding one, as she
often does, of Jane Austen&#8217;s humour, Tasma
does not approach any nearer to that writer&#8217;s
supreme gift of describing character in dialogue
than scores of others who have followed
the same model during the last seventy years.</p>

<p>Like most of the chief contributors to Australian
literature, Tasma is a colonist in experience
only. She was born at Highgate,
near London, and taken during childhood by
her father, Mr. Alfred James Huybers, a
Dutch merchant, to Hobart, in Tasmania,
about forty years ago. She displayed literary
talent at an early age, read extensively, and
published criticisms in the <cite>Melbourne Review</cite>,
and short stories and sketches in the lighter
colonial periodicals.</p>

<p>In 1879 Tasma went to live in Europe,
and has since known Australia only as an
occasional visitor. Becoming interested in
social questions during a residence in France,
she wrote in the <cite>Nouvelle Revue</cite>, suggesting
<a name="png.267" id="png.267"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">263</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>emigration to the colonies and engagement
in the fruit-growing industry there as a means
of relieving some of the poverty of the Old
World. She afterwards lectured on the
subject in French at the invitation of the
Geographical Society of Paris. So successful
were the lectures that she was induced to
repeat them in various provincial centres, as
well as in Holland and Belgium. This work
occupied from 1880 to 1882, and Tasma was
presented by the French Government with the
decoration of Officier d&#8217;Académie. The King
of the Belgians also honoured the lecturer by
receiving her in special audience to discuss
means of improving communication between
Belgium and Tasmania.</p>

<p>In 1885, after revisiting Australia, Tasma
was married to M.&nbsp;Auguste Couvreur, a distinguished
Belgian politician and journalist
(he has since died), and four years later
began her career as a novelist by the publication
at London of <cite>Uncle Piper of Piper&#8217;s
Hill</cite>, which proved to be one of the most
notable books of its season.</p>

<p>This novel remains the best example of
<a name="png.268" id="png.268"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">264</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>the author&#8217;s humour and power of describing
character that she has produced. It has
none of the marks of a first effort. Written
when Tasma was about thirty-two, it embodied
some of the best fruits of many years&#8217;
keenly critical study of life, in addition to the
culture gained by travel and a wide course of
reading. Of plot there is little&mdash;there is still
less in some of the later novels&mdash;but sufficient
variety of incident is given to afford scope
for unusually rich faculties of sympathy and
philosophic observation.</p>

<p>In her desire to present only real persons
moving in a familiar world she merits, in
<cite>Uncle Piper</cite>, praise almost equal to that
accorded by Nathaniel Hawthorne to the
novels of Anthony Trollope when he spoke
of them as being &lsquo;as real as if some giant
had hewn a great lump out of the earth and
put it under a glass case, with all its inhabitants
going about their daily business
and not suspecting that they were being
made a show of.&rsquo; It is, however, less of
Trollope than of Howells that Tasma reminds
the reader in this first story. The
<a name="png.269" id="png.269"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">265</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>character of the wealthy <i>parvenu</i> uncle, sensitive,
boastful, resentful, and obstinate, yet
tender-hearted as a child, irresistibly recalls
<cite>Silas Lapham</cite>, that wonderfully natural and
sympathetic presentment of a commonplace
man. There are numerous points of resemblance
between the two, especially when they
are shown contrasted with their aristocratic
friends. The delightful comradeship of Lapham
and his wife, with its curiously dry New
England expression, has its counterpart in
Piper&#8217;s affection for his sister and their pride
in each other.</p>

<p>The half-acknowledged social ambitions
of both men, qualified by their secret contempt
for the pretensions of the upper classes,
is shown in various similar ways, as is also
their love of display. They differ only as
their nationalities differ. Puritanism survives
in the American merchant and his wife,
and unconsciously sways their lives. Uncle
Piper&#8217;s conception of the Deity is of the
vaguest kind, but he has a religion of
generosity and love which in the end nothing
can repress&mdash;which survives the effects of a
<a name="png.270" id="png.270"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">266</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>temper soured by systematic coldness and
opposition on the part of a rebellious son and
step-daughter. While in his relations with
his womenkind&mdash;the tractable section of
them&mdash;there is nothing of that quaint
American delicacy and reserve noted by
Howells, there is in its stead an absorbing
tenderness which is irresistible.</p>

<p>The superiority of Silas Lapham as a
realistic portrait is not difficult to affirm;
still, it is a fact complimentary to Tasma that
the characters thus far approximate. Uncle
Piper is under all the disadvantage that a
figure in fiction suffers in being described
largely in plain statement by the author
instead of being gradually revealed in piquant
dialogue.</p>

<p>Readers of <cite>Silas Lapham</cite> will remember
the rapid series of witty touches with which
the burly Bostonian is sketched as he sits in
the office of his warehouse, surrounded by
samples of the mineral paint that he is so
pathetically proud of, striving to maintain a
dignified indifference as he answers the rather
flippant curiosity of the local press
<a name="png.271" id="png.271"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">267</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>interviewer. Uncle Piper, on the other hand, is
introduced, as all of Tasma&#8217;s characters are,
in sundry solid-looking pages of direct narrative.
It is true that their humour and epigram
make bright reading, but they are necessarily
without the power of pithy dialogue
to create a vivid impression of character.</p>

<p>Whether Uncle Piper is a type of Australian
plutocracy need hardly be discussed.
Of plebeian tradesmen grown wealthy every
community has its proportion. It may, however,
be said that the owners of luxurious
villas in the suburbs of Melbourne have
individually a good deal more grammar and
less generosity than he who was described
by one of his fashionable English guests as
possessing &lsquo;the home of a West-End magnate
and the intonation of a groom.&rsquo; The
author herself would probably disclaim any
intention to represent a type. She is one
of those writers who doubt the existence of
types in the ordinary meaning of the term,
and she certainly makes no conscious attempt
to delineate them.</p>

<p>A passage in her third novel, <cite>The Penance
<a name="png.272" id="png.272"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">268</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>of Portia James</cite>, gives her views on this
subject, and incidentally upon Australian
character. A description is furnished of a
breakfast-party in the London home of an
Australian who has made his fortune in a
silver-mine, and from being a <i>habitué</i> of
colonial racecourses has lately developed
into a patron of art and a purchaser of
dubious &lsquo;old masters&rsquo; at exorbitant prices.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To hold up the assembled party to the eyes of English
readers as thoroughly typical Australians would be as
unjust a proceeding as was that of Dumas <i>père</i> when he
declared that all the inhabitants of Antwerp were <i>roux</i>
because he had encountered two red-headed girls on his
way to the hotel. No one is thoroughly typical unless
he be a savage or a peasant. Portia and her relatives
retained their own underlying individualities none the
less that they had been influenced in their outward
bearing and modes of expressing themselves by a long
sojourn in the backwoods of Victoria, in daily contact
with all sorts and conditions of men&mdash;broken-down
gentlemen, English yokels, bush-hands, and the like.
After all, the moulding of character by outward influences
alone is not a work to be achieved in one
generation, or what would become of the theory of
heredity, upon which everything is supposed to depend,
more or less, in our present scientific age? If these
people strike the English reader, therefore, as differing
in certain respects from those he is accustomed to meet
in his daily walk through life, let him remember that the
<a name="png.273" id="png.273"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">269</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>differences which will strike him most are the merely
superficial ones resulting from an occasional departure
from the conventional rules of speech and behaviour that
guide his own outward conduct, and that in all the main
essentials they are, <i>au fond</i>, neither more like him or
more unlike him than though chance had willed that
they should be born and brought up on the selfsame
patch of earth as himself. A difference in the vocabulary
of the native-born Australian, or long resident in
Australia, of the not too highly educated order, as well
as a difference in his tone of voice and enunciation, from
that of a person belonging to a corresponding class in
England, is one of those facts, however, which &lsquo;nobody
can deny.&rsquo; I am not going to enter in this connection
upon a disquisition respecting the relative merits of what
Mrs. James would have called &lsquo;höfisch&rsquo; English, and
the English that has been coined out of entirely new
conditions by pioneers and backwoodsmen. Suffice it
to say there <em>is</em> a difference, and Portia was never more
sensible of it than when she returned, as on the present
occasion, from moving among a London society crowd
into the Anglo-Australian social atmosphere of the Kensington
house.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tasma&#8217;s efforts to give variety to her work,
and keep as far as possible out of the beaten
paths of the Australian writer, have not, however,
quite excluded from her novels characters
which will be recognised as typical.
There is, for instance, the young pleasure-loving
<a name="png.274" id="png.274"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">270</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>colonial man who keeps racehorses,
gets deeply into debt and love, and has
sometimes to encounter awkward parental
alternatives.</p>

<p>At least three excellent portraits of such
men are given. The best is that of George
Drafton, in <cite>In Her Earliest Youth</cite>. In no
other novel are the rough good-nature and
loose, slangy talk of the young Australian
sportsman of the upper-middle class more
naturally expressed. The author&#8217;s knowledge
of the cant terms and short cuts in the
vocabulary of the not necessarily ill-educated
but supremely careless colonial young man is
almost equal to that of Rolf Boldrewood, who
has been listening to the talk of such men all
his life.</p>

<p>Uncle Piper&#8217;s exasperating &lsquo;gentleman&rsquo;
son George is also a noticeably clever
creation in a book full of good portraits;
and it is a tribute to the author&#8217;s skill that
as the story progresses our sympathy for
him increases rather than diminishes, notwithstanding
the needless agonies of rage he
occasions his father.</p>

<p><a name="png.275" id="png.275"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">271</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>The most vivid chapter to be found in any
of Tasma&#8217;s novels is that in which Uncle
Piper, after witnessing a love-scene between
Laura Lydiat and George, sends for the
latter and threatens to cast him off if a
marriage of the pair should take place.
Laura is an agnostic and a sort of &lsquo;new
woman&rsquo; who maintains a constant attitude
of disdain towards her stepfather. She and
George have spent much of their youth
together, discussed pessimistic theories in
Piper&#8217;s hearing, and generally ignored him,
and made him feel his ignorance in ways
very trying to the temper of a man who,
&lsquo;now that his money-making days were over,
had a passion for dictating absolutely to
everyone about him.&rsquo; &lsquo;He&#8217;d talk&rsquo; and &lsquo;she&#8217;d
talk,&rsquo; as Mr. Piper would complain; &lsquo;and
they&#8217;d spout their scraps of poetry that hadn&#8217;t
an ounce of the sense any good, honest old
rhyme could show; and you&#8217;d think, to hear
them, they were doing their Maker a favour
by condescending to go on living at all!&rsquo;</p>

<p>An alliance of this kind between the two
people for whom he had done most with his
<a name="png.276" id="png.276"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">272</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>wealth was bad enough, but Uncle Piper was
determined that it should not become a closer
one. Was this not one reason for his importation
of an entire family of impoverished
relatives, that they and his little pet daughter,
the angelic Louey, should readjust the balance
of household power in his favour?</p>

<p>It was on the eve of the arrival of his
aristocratic connections, the Cavendishes,
that he determined to put a stop to his son&#8217;s
courtship. George, at the outset of the
momentous interview with his father, speculated
inwardly on his chances of being able
to soften the old man to a favourable view of
&lsquo;the only wish that he had ever framed with
a feeling that savoured of intensity.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Before entering the ornamental tower where
his father awaited him, George had composed
his face to its usual expression of
laziest indifference. His imperturbability
always &lsquo;had the effect of a goad upon
his father&#8217;s temper. His face never changed
colour when the old man&#8217;s was purple. His
voice never lost its measured drawl.&rsquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As Mr. Piper turned and faced him you would never
<a name="png.277" id="png.277"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">273</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>have traced the sonship in George. There was nothing
in common between the sallow, indolent face of the
younger man, and the spreading, heated face of the
elder. George looked like any club-lounger&mdash;not unwilling
to let it be seen that he is slightly bored, yet
ready, with perfect acquiescence, to go through with an
hour or a forenoon of the infliction of boredom, as conveyed
by a father&#8217;s presence&hellip;. Mr. Piper watched
him as he continued tranquilly to pare his nails, the
baffled sense of helplessness that exasperated him at the
outset of an interview with his son creeping over him as
he watched. If George could only once have lost his
head and sworn, or only once implored or threatened!
But he never did. The apathy and unconcern of his
attitude&mdash;the veiled disrespect it implied&mdash;spoke of an
indifference that was worse than the most open revolt.
But surely he would be made to feel now! Mr. Piper
had never tried to reach &lsquo;my gentleman&rsquo; through his
&lsquo;young woman&rsquo; yet&hellip;. A slight elevation of an unruffled
brow just gave evidence that though his eyes were
looking critically at his almond-shaped finger-nails, his
ear took in the sense of his fathers words. Otherwise
he might have served as a perfect model of intentness
upon his hands, as the statue of the boy who to all
eternity will be absorbed in the task of extracting a thorn
from his foot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Piper is in a state of acute
excitement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;ll see and put a stop to it!&rsquo; he threatened. &lsquo;I&#8217;ll
take and pack her off, and you at the back of her, &ldquo;my
gentleman&rdquo;!&rsquo; George knew that the use of this expression
<a name="png.278" id="png.278"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">274</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>signified especial bitterness on his father&#8217;s part.
&lsquo;I&#8217;ll have an end of this nonsense&mdash;a painted jade like
her!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Wait a minute, please,&rsquo; said George, shutting the
knife with a little snap, and settling himself back upon
the window-sill; &lsquo;you are a little hard to follow, or I am
slow at catching your meaning, perhaps. I understand
that you had some object in sending for me. Are you
explaining it to me now? I am quite prepared to listen,
as you see.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You&#8217;re very condescending, I&#8217;m sure,&rsquo; said Mr. Piper,
with such withering sarcasm that George stroked his
moustache and smiled. &lsquo;You put yourself about for
your father a deal too much, &ldquo;my gentleman,&rdquo; there&#8217;s
no doubt of it.&rsquo; Then, with a sudden break in his
voice: &lsquo;No, George; it&#8217;s not much of a son you&#8217;ve been
to me, and no one can say I&#8217;ve stood in your light. I&#8217;d
like you to show me another young man who could carry
on top ropes like you. There&#8217;s not many fathers &#8217;ud
have stood it. Most fathers &#8217;ud made you turn to long
ago.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do you want anything done for you?&rsquo; interrupted
George, with the air of a man who is laying himself out
to oblige&mdash;&lsquo;another tour of inspection in the north?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Whenever Mr. Piper made allusion to George&#8217;s want
of occupation, it was the young man&#8217;s policy to refer to
this tour of inspection&mdash;a memorable tour, seeing that it
had given him employment for at least three months&hellip;.</p>

<p>If there was anything humiliating in being rated as an
&lsquo;able-bodied young man who wasn&#8217;t worth his salt,&rsquo; as a
loafer who was hardly fit to &lsquo;jackaroo&rsquo; on a station, as
a &lsquo;lazy lubber&rsquo; who would &lsquo;go to the dogs if it weren&#8217;t
<a name="png.279" id="png.279"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">275</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>for his father,&rsquo; George never betrayed that he felt humiliated
by so much as the twitching of an eyelid. Persistently
stroking the ends of his moustache with an air of
profound abstraction, he made it apparent, as soon as
Mr. Piper stopped to take breath, that he was suppressing
an inclination to yawn.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I dare say it&#8217;s all very true, governor,&rsquo; was all he said
in reply. &lsquo;It&#8217;s very nice and complimentary, I&#8217;m sure,
and I ought to be very much obliged to you. But,
<i>à propos</i> of your compliments, may I ask if it was only
to treat me to them in full that you brought me up those
confounded tower steps this morning? Because, in that
case, I wouldn&#8217;t have minded waiting, you know. It&#8217;s
hardly fair upon a man, is it, to put him to the treadmill
before he&#8217;s well awake in the morning?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you were like other young men,&rsquo; retorted Mr.
Piper, &lsquo;you&#8217;d be up and down them steps twenty times
a day&rsquo; (George shuddered); &lsquo;but oh no! my gentleman
can crawl on to the lawn and carry on <span class="nw">with a&mdash;&mdash;</span>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Stop there!&rsquo; cried George, in a tone that made his
father silent through sheer astonishment (George had
never been known to raise his voice before). &lsquo;Do you
know the relation in which Laura stands to me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>He looked Mr. Piper full in the face as he said it, and
seeing the ghastly change that came over the face as he
looked, he felt that he had been over-hasty. For the
glass through which Mr. Piper had made a feint of
looking dropped from his quivering fingers and his lips
worked in a distorted fashion over his discoloured teeth;
the blood rushing away from his florid cheeks left them
streaked with thready, sanguineous veins, mottling the
ash-coloured patches; and rushed back again with a
<a name="png.280" id="png.280"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">276</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>force that seemed to swell the veins round his temples
to bursting&hellip;.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What&#8217;s the matter, father?&rsquo; said George at last, not
with any of Louey&#8217;s vehement alarm, but eyeing him
rather gravely and curiously. &lsquo;Do you object to my
looking upon Laura in the light of a&mdash;<em>sister</em>?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Eh?&rsquo; said Mr. Piper. His power of articulation was
slowly returning, but his breath as yet was only equal to
the monosyllable.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Of a sister,&rsquo; repeated George slowly, &lsquo;and a friend.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Your <em>sister</em>!&rsquo; said Mr. Piper, as soon as he could
speak distinctly. &lsquo;That&#8217;s as you choose to take it.
She&#8217;s none o&#8217; mine, thank God! But you take and
make her more than your sister, and see how soon you&#8217;ll
come to repent it. It&#8217;s down in my will. I&#8217;ve sworn it.
Dead or alive, I won&#8217;t have the jade in my family! If
you&#8217;ve got a fancy for her, you may take her, but never
come anigh Piper&#8217;s Hill again!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You mistake the position of affairs,&rsquo; said George
calmly. &lsquo;Laura wouldn&#8217;t have me if I wanted!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ho, ho!&rsquo; Mr. Piper&#8217;s laugh was more insulting than
mirthful. &lsquo;That&#8217;s why she comes and hugs you on the
lawn of a morning, is it?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The interview ended with an intimation that
Mr. Piper will not have Laura as a daughter-in-law
&lsquo;at any price,&rsquo; and that if George
choose to marry her it must be as a pauper,
and unrelieved of his heavy burden of turf
debts.  Piper&#8217;s stormy, almost speechless
<a name="png.281" id="png.281"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">277</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>anger, like his craving for sympathy and
approval, are alike often exceedingly pathetic.
His personality, though less delicately drawn
than that of his niece, Sara Cavendish, is a
striking figure throughout the book. A good
delineation of an old man is sufficiently rare
in fiction to make that of Uncle Piper notable.
Tasma has not equalled this performance in
any of her other works. Josiah Carp, the
Melbourne merchant in <cite>In Her Earliest
Youth</cite>, and Sir Matthew Bogg, another of
the same class, in the short story <cite>Monsieur
Caloche</cite>, are shown only in a satirical and
repulsive light, which necessarily makes
them appear somewhat unreal.</p>

<p>As a vivid study, combined with excellent
comedy, the portrait of Sara Cavendish
would not have been unworthy of Thackeray.
The selfishness concealed by her demure
exterior and great beauty, and the absurdly
excessive estimate of her virtues made by
the Reverend Francis Lydiat, are a warning
to all susceptible young men. Lydiat was a
passenger by the ship which carried Sara
and her parents to Australia.  When he
<a name="png.282" id="png.282"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">278</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>gave his weekly sermons during the voyage,
Miss Cavendish was always present, and
looked at him with her large eyes to such
purpose that they &lsquo;seemed to be absorbing
his meaning into the soul of their possessor.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But there was nothing ethereal in Sara&#8217;s
thoughts. &lsquo;She had a fancy for imagining
becoming dresses. She would build up a
delightful wardrobe in the air, entering into
as many details of her airy outfit as though it
could be instantly materialised. And she
liked to imagine a becoming background for
her own beautiful person, in which a husband
with the essentials of good birth and unlimited
money, and the desirable qualifications
of an air of distinction and great
devotion to her, filled a reasonable space.&rsquo;
Lydiat had often seen her lost in daydreams
such as it would have seemed to him almost
a sacrilege to disturb, &lsquo;though it is probable
that the only notion he would have been
guilty of upsetting had reference to the
shape of an imaginary velvet train.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The insight and completeness with which
<a name="png.283" id="png.283"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">279</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Sara&#8217;s character is depicted in the course of
the story make it impossible that the reader
should entirely dislike her as a mere sample
of the calculating coquette. She is one of
that large class of women, with a limited
capacity for affection, whose natures expand
only in an atmosphere of luxury. &lsquo;Don&#8217;t be
shocked,&rsquo; she says to her sister in reference
to the unsuccessful suit of her clerical lover;
&lsquo;I never intended to be a poor man&#8217;s wife.&rsquo;
As a contrast to the cold personality of the
beautiful Sara, the author gives a charming
picture of the elder sister&#8217;s affection and
thoughtfulness for others.</p>

<p>Margaret Cavendish and Eila Frost, in
<cite>Not Counting the Cost</cite>, are good women of a
perfectly possible and natural kind, and it is
surprising to think that the same hand which
drew them also found patience to draw the
unhappy, metaphysical heroines of <cite>In Her
Earliest Youth</cite> and <cite>The Knight of the White
Feather</cite>. Tasma is seldom so pleasing as
when describing the characters of children,
of whom several figure prominently in her
novels.  There is a delightful picture of
<a name="png.284" id="png.284"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">280</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>romping childhood at the opening of <cite>Not
Counting the Cost</cite>. The scene is a farm in
the shadow of Mount Wellington, near
Hobart, the city where the author spent
many of her own early years. &lsquo;Chubby,&rsquo;
the eight-year-old uncle of the heroine of
<cite>In Her Earliest Youth</cite>, and Louey Piper
are lovable creations, though, it must be said,
more quaint than natural. One remembers
the expansive dignity of the former on his
first meeting with Pauline&#8217;s lover, George
Drafton. &lsquo;How do you do, little man?&rsquo;
says the latter condescendingly. &lsquo;How do
you do, sir?&rsquo; replies the little man stiffly,
raising his garden hat. &lsquo;You are an acquaintance
of Paul&mdash;of Miss Vyner&#8217;s, I
believe. I have the honour to be her
maternal uncle.&rsquo; No wonder George bursts
into a loud guffaw, notwithstanding the tragic
intensity of his love protestations of five
minutes before!</p>

<p>Louey Piper&#8217;s relations with her father are
idyllic. She is more necessary to him than
Eppie to Silas Marner; she is a continual
negotiator of peace in his divided house, and
<a name="png.285" id="png.285"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">281</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>&lsquo;in this she could not have displayed more
courtier-like sagacity had she been an old-world
changeling with centuries of experience
respecting rich fathers of uncertain testamentary
inclinations.&rsquo; In her limited knowledge
of things outside Piper&#8217;s Hill, &lsquo;street-crossings
and railway-platforms presented
themselves to her in the light of shocking
and mysterious man-traps&hellip;. The wistful,
yearning look that gave her eyes so touching
an expression in the setting of her small
freckled face never gave place to such a
fulness of satisfaction as when her father,
her brother, and her sister were all, as it
were, under her eye, and safe to remain
indoors for the night.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The general praise won by <cite>Uncle Piper</cite>
for its author as a delineator of character
appears to have decided her to give increased
attention to her ability in this direction. The
immediate result was scarcely a happy one.
The analytical bias disclosed in the first story
was largely extended in the second, with the
usual accompaniment of a decrease in action
and humour.  Pauline Vyner, the central
<a name="png.286" id="png.286"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">282</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>figure of <cite>In Her Earliest Youth</cite>, a sensitive
and speculative girl, marries without love a
man who has saved the life of a child to
whom she is much attached. In tastes and
intellectual bent the pair are almost without
anything in common. The story&mdash;an unusually
long three-volume one&mdash;is mainly a
minute study of Pauline&#8217;s disillusionment
during the early period of her wifehood:
how she escaped the temptations placed in
her way by a man who had formerly attracted
her; and how, with the birth of her first child,
she experienced the dawn of affection for its
father.</p>

<p>The story is excessively expanded for the
small amount of dramatic movement it contains.
Only three characters are prominently
described, and these too seldom through the
medium of dialogue. The central motive,
moreover, is lacking in strength. It is difficult
to appreciate the tragic pathos of so
common a matrimonial error as Pauline&#8217;s,
especially as George, though uncongenial in
his tastes, and not exempt from the ordinary
weaknesses of men, is entirely devoted to
<a name="png.287" id="png.287"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">283</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>her, and would readily have improved under
her influence, had she chosen to exert any.
Tasma&#8217;s more recent work is better both
in spirit and literary construction. Very
sympathetic and entertaining is the narrative,
in <cite>Not Counting the Cost</cite>, of the adventures
of the Clare family in their quixotic travels
in search of the cousin who is to restore
them a long-lost heritage. In this story and
<cite>The Penance of Portia James</cite> the author
gives some interesting scenes of Paris life.
But to get the best samples of her humour,
one must return to her first novel. The
burlesque of Piper&#8217;s pompous, genteel brother-in-law
is delicious. Mr. Cavendish affects to
be revolted by the necessity of being indebted
to the <i>ci-devant</i> butcher, while secretly luxuriating
in his munificence. Finally, as a
means of discharging some of his obligations,
he conceives the project of hunting up a
pedigree for his plebeian relative, after the
manner of the enterprising person who opened
a &lsquo;heraldry office&rsquo; in Sydney about fifty
years ago, and announced his readiness to
provide clients with reliable information of
<a name="png.288" id="png.288"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">284</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>their ancestors, together with suitable coats
of arms.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>True, Piper is not a name of much promise, but there
<em>had</em> been a Count Piper somewhere or other some
centuries ago, and the very rarity of the name proved
that every Piper must come from one common stock.
Fired by this generous idea, Mr. Cavendish gave himself
up to its pursuit with enthusiasm. He would spend
whole hours in the Melbourne Library poring over books
of heraldry. Every chronological or biographical document
bearing upon the age in which Count Piper was
supposed to have lived was made the subject of long and
minute examination. When the monthly mail day came
round there would sure to be a budget of letters in
Mr. Cavendish&#8217;s handwriting, addressed to the different
colleges and societies at home and abroad, who were to
help in extracting all Pipers of any importance from the
oblivion in which they had hitherto been suffered to
remain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Piper is at length informed of the
progress of the inquiries, but shows a provoking
obtuseness and indifference concerning
them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;I am&mdash;hem!&mdash;I am pursuing a task of the utmost
consequence to your family interests,&rsquo; Mr. Cavendish
had told him one day. &lsquo;In fact, my dear sir, I am
engaged in a work of no less moment than that of
reconstructing your family tree.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My what-do-you-call-it tree?&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Piper,
<a name="png.289" id="png.289"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">285</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>with a hazy idea that Mr. Cavendish had been trying
some unwarrantable experiments upon his lemon and
orange bushes. &lsquo;Don&#8217;t you take and put any rubbish in
the garden. I&#8217;ve got a new lot of guano, and I don&#8217;t
want it meddled with.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Guano!&rsquo; echoed Mr. Cavendish, with a tone of the
most withering compassion. &lsquo;I&#8217;m afraid you don&#8217;t quite
apprehend my meaning. I am not alluding to coarse
material facts at all. I am speaking of a genealogical
tree&mdash;a ge-ne-a-lo-gi-cal tree, you understand? I am
trying to rescue your ancestors from the dust of oblivion.
I am&hellip;.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You&#8217;d better leave &#8217;em alone,&rsquo; interrupted Mr. Piper,
with the sulky accent of one whose suspicions have not
been altogether allayed. &lsquo;<em>They</em> won&#8217;t do you any good&mdash;no
more than they&#8217;ve done for me. You&#8217;ve got some
of your own, I expect; that&#8217;s enough for any man, I
should think.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Cavendish shrugged his shoulders and held his
peace. If the matter had not become a hobby by
this time, he would have abandoned it then and there.
As it was, he contented himself by deploring the sad
effects of low association upon the undoubted descendant
of a count, and pondering upon the possibility of introducing
a hog in armour instead of a stag at gaze into the
coat-of-arms that he foresaw would be the result of his
researches.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Equally comical is the spectacle of Mrs.
Cavendish, on the eve of the first meeting
of the two men, humbly wondering how she
<a name="png.290" id="png.290"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">286</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>could soften the heart of her discontented
lord towards the low-born brother&mdash;&lsquo;how
lead him to pardon, as it were, his benefactor
for having dared to benefit him,&rsquo; and the
subsequent reflection of Cavendish that not
only was wealth an acknowledged power,
&lsquo;even though pork-sausages should have been
its alleged first cause,&rsquo; but that, after all,
&lsquo;politic members of the great ruling houses
in the old world had been known to make
concessions to trade,&rsquo; and he &lsquo;was prepared
to make concessions too!&rsquo; Accordingly, he
resolved that the meeting with his relative
should bear the semblance of cordiality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;This is a real pleasure, my dear sir,&rsquo; he said, with ten
white fingers&mdash;the fingers of thoroughbred hands&mdash;closing
round Mr. Piper&#8217;s plebeian knuckles. No onlooker
could have supposed for an instant that he had
come, with the whole of his family, in an entirely destitute
condition, to live upon his wife&#8217;s brother. Besides,
we know that among well-bred people, to receive a favour
is virtually to oblige a man. You only accept cordialities
from people you esteem&hellip;.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You&#8217;re welcome, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Piper.</p>

<p>Then there was a pause, during which Mrs. Cavendish
wiped her eyes, and Mr. Piper said very heartily, &lsquo;You&#8217;re
welcome, the lot of you.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a name="png.291" id="png.291"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">287</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Cavendish is the only character that the
author has treated in a consistently farcical
vein. Eila Frost&#8217;s canting old father-in-law
in <cite>Not Counting the Cost</cite> is made ridiculous
in his harangue on the duties of the young
wife to her insane husband; but, with this
exception, little is said of him in the story.
It would seem that Tasma regards broadly
humorous exaggeration to be scarcely compatible
with her somewhat grave style, for
in all the later stories her satire, if not less
pungent, is of a quieter kind.</p>

<p>Next to their humour and skilful presentation
of character, the most noteworthy feature
of these novels is their lucid and polished
language. The style is, perhaps, scarcely
easy enough for fiction. Its qualities and
culture are those that equip the essayist or
critic rather than the novelist. Indeed, judged
by some of her early work in the reviews,
and by the little philosophic exordiums with
which she opens so many of her chapters,
Tasma would have made a brilliant essayist.
To a large class of thoughtful readers it will
always seem that what her novels lack in
<a name="png.292" id="png.292"></a><span class="ns">[p </span><span
 class="pgmark">288</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>dramatic interest is fully compensated for
by their more than usually faithful sketches
of both men and women, and by their intimate
and sympathetic view of our common
life.</p>
